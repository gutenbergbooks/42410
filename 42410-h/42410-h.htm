<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>



<p>The plan of the following work, whatever may be thought of its execution,
will commend itself, it is believed, to the taste and judgment of the public. It
proceeds upon the principle of <i>selection</i>, being chiefly confined to the <i>Great
Events</i> of American History, and which are treated of as <i>distinct subjects</i>. In
these respects, the work differs from other historical works on the same subject.</p>

<p>The advantages of a work thus constructed, are too obvious to need specification.
Yet, it may be remarked, that great events in history are like great
objects in nature and art. It is the bolder features of a country&mdash;the more
costly and imposing edifices of the city&mdash;the higher and more elaborate achievements
of art&mdash;upon which we delight to dwell. In like manner, great events
attract our attention and interest our minds, because of their relations&mdash;because
of the higher qualities of mind which, perhaps, gave them birth, and the striking
and lasting changes which grow out of them. They serve as landmarks in our
drift down the stream of time. We date from them. We refer to them. We
measure between them. We compare them one with another&mdash;their causes,
progress, influences; and, in so doing, our knowledge of men and things is
advanced&mdash;our false opinions are corrected&mdash;our topics for interesting and
profitable speculation and reflection greatly multiplied. A thorough perusal of
a work thus constructed will secure, it is believed, a more competent and permanent
knowledge of the history of a country, than some half-dozen readings
of that history, written on the ordinary plan.</p>

<p>The principle of selection will render the work the more valuable to certain
classes of persons&mdash;to those who, desirous of a competent knowledge of the
history of their country, have but a limited time to devote to the study of it;
to the young, whose minds are apt to become wearied and perplexed with the
number and details of minor events; and to those who wish to refresh their
recollections, without the labor and loss of time incident to the perusal of works
constructed on the common plan. Each of these classes will find their interests
consulted in the work before them, while the general reader may profitably proceed
from the perusal of such a volume to those which describe events and
details more minutely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>In regard to what constitute the 'Great Events of American History,' there
may be some diversity of opinion. As to <i>his</i> selection, the author has not the
vanity to suppose that it is the best that could be made. The journey has been
a long one; and surely, it were not strange, if some events had been magnified
into an undue importance; while those of perhaps even higher consideration
were neglected, either for want of a better judgment, or for want of more
serious reflection.</p>

<p>In the progress of the work, the author has endeavored to do justice to the
original settlers of the United States, and their immediate descendants, by
bringing into view their constant sense of their dependence upon God. It will
be seen that our forefathers were men who feared God&mdash;who sought his blessing
in all their great enterprises; and when success crowned those enterprises, that
they were ready to acknowledge His good hand which had been with them.
In seasons of darkness, they fasted and prayed: in seasons of prosperity, they
rejoiced and gave thanks.</p>

<p>In these respects, our ancestors did, indeed, only their duty; but, it may well
be urged upon the rising generation, which will soon take the management of
the affairs of this already-mighty nation&mdash;and which is growing in population,
wealth, and importance, every year&mdash;to imitate an example so just! so beautiful!
so impressive!</p>

<p>The author has briefly to add, that the work was begun some years since;
but, until now, he has found no opportunity to complete it; nor should he, even
at this date, have had that pleasure, but for the important aid of a highly valued
literary friend, long favorably known to the public, Rev. <span class="smcap">Royal Robbins</span>, of
Berlin, Ct., to whom, in this place, he is happy to make his acknowledgments
for valuable portions of the volume.</p>

<p>If it be remarkable that the Western Continent should have
remained unknown for so many centuries to civilized man, it
is, perhaps, still more remarkable that since its discovery and
settlement, it should have become the theatre of so many signal
transactions, and have advanced so rapidly to its present civil,
religious, and political importance. The history of every portion
of it is interesting and instructive; but more especially that portion
occupied by the people of the United States. A great work
is in progress throughout the entire continent; but the importance
of the American Republic, with which our fortunes are more
immediately connected, is becoming apparent with each revolving
year. While, therefore, we propose to make an historical survey
of the several countries both of North and South America, we
shall dwell with greater particularity upon the events which have
signalized our own republican America. If not from her present
population, which, though increasing by a wonderful progression,
is still, in point of numbers, inferior to many other nations; yet,
from her wealth, her enterprise, her commercial and political
relations, she is entitled to rank among the most powerful and
influential nations on the globe. The eyes of the civilized world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
are upon her; and with wonder, if not with jealousy, do they
mark her rapid and surprising advancement.</p>

<p>The <i>history</i> of such a people must be full of interest. By what
means has her national elevation been maintained? But a little
more than two centuries have elapsed, since the first settlers
planted themselves at Jamestown, in Virginia, and the Pilgrim
Fathers landed on Plymouth Rock. They were then a feeble
band. Before them lay a howling wilderness. An inhospitable
and intractable race rose up to oppose and harass them. The
means of living were stinted and uncertain. Famine pressed upon
them, and weakened them. The winters were cold and piercing.
Their habitations were rude and unprotective. Disease added its
sufferings and sorrows, and death hurried many of the few to an
untimely grave. Yet, amidst accumulated calamity, they gathered
strength and courage. Accessions from the mother-country were
made to their numbers. Other and distant stations were occupied.
The forest fell before them. Towns and villages rose in the
wilderness, and solitary places became glad. Savage tribes&mdash;after
years of terror, massacre, and bloodshed&mdash;retired, leaving
the colonists to the peaceful occupancy of the land, in all its
length and breadth.</p>

<p>But they were still a dependant people&mdash;subject to the laws,
exactions, and oppressions of a proud and arbitrary foreign government.
That government, jealous of their growing importance,
adopted measures to check their aspirations, and to extend and
perpetuate the prerogatives of the crown. But it was impossible
that a people, sprung from the loins of fathers whose courage and
enterprise had been matured by years of conflict, should be either
crushed, or long thwarted in their plans. Oppressions served
rather to strengthen them; threats prompted to resolution, and
served to inspire confidence. And, at length, they arose to the
assertion and maintenance of their rights. They entered the
field; and for years, with all the fortunes of war apparently
against them, they grappled successfully with the colossal power
of the British empire&mdash;thwarted her counsels&mdash;conquered her

<p>But a little more than seventy years has America been free
from the British yoke; yet, in that brief period, her advancement
has outstripped all the predictions of the most sanguine statesmen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
With but three millions of people, she entered the Revolutionary
contest; she now numbers more than twenty millions. Instead
of thirteen colonies, she embraces thirty free and independent
states. Meanwhile, she has continued to gather national strength
and national importance. Her wealth is rolling up, while her
moral power is becoming the admiration of the world.</p>

<p>These attainments, too, she has made amid convulsions and
revolutions, which have shaken the proudest empires, and spread
desolation over some of the fairest portions of the globe. On
every side are the evidences of her advancement. Genius and
industry are creating and rolling forward with amazing power
and rapidity the means of national wealth and aggrandizement.
An enterprising, ardent, restless population are spreading over
our western wilds, and our cities are now the creations almost
of a day.</p>

<p>But by what means has this national elevation and prosperity
been attained? Shall we ascribe them to the wise, sagacious, and
patriotic men, who guided our councils and led our armies? Shall
we offer our homage and gratitude to <span class="smcap">Washington</span>, <span class="smcap">Franklin</span>,
<span class="smcap">Adams</span>, <span class="smcap">Otis</span>, <span class="smcap">Henry</span>, <span class="smcap">Jefferson</span>, and a multitude of others, who
periled fortune, liberty, life itself, to achieve our independence,
and lay the foundation of our country's glory?</p>

<p>Let us do them honor; and a nation's honor and gratitude will
be accorded to them, so long as the recorded history of their noble
achievements shall last.</p>

<p>But, while merited honor is paid to the sages and heroes of the
Revolution, and to the Pilgrim Fathers of an earlier age, let not
the hand of Providence be overlooked or disregarded.</p>

<p>On this point, the Puritans have left a noble example to their
posterity. The supplication of the smiles and blessings of a
superintending Providence preceded and accompanied all their
plans and all their enterprises. "God was their king; and they
regarded him as truly and literally so, as if he had dwelt in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
visible palace in the midst of their state. They were his devoted,
resolute, humble subjects; they undertook nothing which they did
not beg of him to prosper; they accomplished nothing without
rendering to him the praise; they suffered nothing without carrying
up their sorrows to his throne; they ate nothing which they
did not implore him to bless." Nor were the actors in the Revolutionary
struggle insensible to the necessity of the Divine blessing
upon their counsels and efforts. Washington, as well at the head
of his army as in the retirement of his closet, or amid some
secluded spot in the field, looked up for the blessing of the God
of battles. That also was a beautiful recognition of a superintending
Providence, which Franklin made in the Convention,
which, subsequent to the Revolution, framed the Constitution.
"I have lived, sir, a long time," said he; "and the longer I live,
the more convincing proof I see of this truth, that <i>God governs in
the affairs of men</i>. And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground
without his notice, is it probable that an empire can rise without
his aid?"</p>

<p>Let it be remembered by the American people&mdash;by men who
fill her councils&mdash;by historians who write her history&mdash;by the
young, who are coming up to the possession of the rich inheritance,
that whatever human agencies were employed in the discovery,
settlement, independence, and prosperity of these states, the "good
hand of God has been over and around us," and has given to us
this goodly land, with its religious institutions&mdash;its free government&mdash;its
unwonted prosperity.</p>

<p>Let not the historian, who writes&mdash;especially if he writes for
the <i>young</i>&mdash;be thought to travel out of his appropriate sphere, in
an effort to imbue the rising generation with somewhat of the
religious spirit of the fathers&mdash;to lead them to recognise the Divine
government, in respect to nations as well as individuals&mdash;to impress
upon them that sentiment of the "Father of his country," as just
as impressive, viz: "Of all the dispositions and habits which lead
to political prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable
supports."</p>

<p>"When the children of the Pilgrims forget that Being who was
the Pilgrims guide and deliverer"&mdash;should they ever be so faulty
and unfortunate&mdash;when the descendants of the Puritans cease to
acknowledge, and obey, and love that Being, for whose service the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
Puritans forsook all that men chiefly love, enduring scorn and
reproach, exile and poverty, and finding at last a superabundant
reward; when the sons of a religious and holy ancestry fall away
from its high communion, and join themselves to the assemblies
of the profane, they have forfeited the dear blessings of their
inheritance; and they deserve to be cast out from this fair land,
without even a wilderness for their refuge. No! let us still keep
the ark of God in the midst of us; let us adopt the prayer of the
wise monarch of Israel: "The Lord our God be with us, as he
was with our fathers; let him not leave us nor forsake us; that
he may incline our hearts unto him, to walk in all his ways, and
to keep his commandments and his statutes and his judgments,
which he commanded our fathers."</p>

<p>Such a regard for God&mdash;his laws&mdash;his institutions, and his service,
is obligatory upon the present generation, aside from those blessings
which may be justly anticipated as the reward of such reverence
and obedience. It is due to the memory of the Pilgrim Fathers.
Never can we so worthily and appropriately honor them, as to
cherish the pious sentiments which they cherished, and perpetuate
the civil and religious institutions which they founded.&mdash;It is due
to the generation of our Revolutionary era, which, impressed with
a sense of the value of the inheritance transmitted to them, periled
life and fortune that they might transmit that inheritance in all its
fullness and in all its richness to their posterity. We are the
children of patriot heroes, who prayed and then fought, and fought
and then prayed.&mdash;It is due to ourselves, as we would secure the
admiration and gratitude of the generations which are to follow
us.&mdash;It is due to those generations which, by the blessing of God,
are to spread over and occupy the vast territory which now constitutes
the American republic.</p>

<p>Those generations! I see them rising and spreading abroad, as
future years roll on! What shall be their character&mdash;their regard
for civil and religious liberty&mdash;their peace, order, happiness, and
prosperity, may depend upon the example which we set, and the
principles which we inculcate. We are living and acting not only
for the present, but for the future. We are making impressions
for all time to come. If, then, our history for the future shall be
as our history past&mdash;filled up with divine blessings, and signal
providential interpositions&mdash;if the noble work begun, centuries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
since, is to go on&mdash;if the "fullest liberty and the purest religion"
are to prevail as time rolls on&mdash;if this vast continent is to be
inhabited by enlightened and happy millions&mdash;we, who are now
on the stage of action, must imitate the example of that pilgrim
band, which first landed on Plymouth Rock.</p>

<p>Under the influence of such an example transmitted from generation
to generation, we may hope that our beloved country will
ultimately become, if she is not already,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The queen of the world, and the child of the skies."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Impressed with the importance of such sentiments himself, the
author will make no apology for offering them as, in his own
view, an appropriate introduction to a work chiefly designed for
the benefit of the rising generation.</p>

<p>No event, in the history of modern ages, surpasses in
interest the discovery of the American Continent. It has
scarcely any parallel, indeed, in the annals of the world;
whether we consider the difficulty of the undertaking or
the magnitude of its consequences. Without any serious
question, the honor of the discovery belongs solely to
<span class="smcap">Christopher Columbus</span>. Mankind, hitherto, have so
awarded it, and posterity will doubtless confirm the judgment.
As, however, a claim to a prior discovery by the
<i>Northmen</i> has been brought forward in recent times, it
becomes the impartiality of history to notice it, and to give
such an account of the circumstances on which the claim
is founded, as they may appear to deserve. Whether or
not, at the distance of some four or five centuries, the trans-Atlantic
continent had been discovered by the Scandinavian
voyagers, the merits of the great Italian are far from being
affected by the fact.</p>

   <p class="caption2">Northmen leaving Iceland.</p>
</div>

<p>The prominent incidents in this alleged ante-Columbian
discovery, it seems, are given on the authority of certain
Icelandic manuscripts, the genuineness, and even the
existence of which, have formerly been doubted by many;
but which, there is now reason to suppose, are entitled to
credence. The general story may be received as probable.
In the details, there is often something too vague, if
not too extraordinary, to entitle it to any historical importance.
The adventurous spirit, and even the naval skill of
the Northmen, are not a matter of doubt with any who are
acquainted with the history of the times to which reference
is here made. The seas and the coasts of Europe were
the scenes of their exploits&mdash;their piracies, their battles, or
their colonization. According to the Icelandic statements,
Eric the Red, in 986, emigrated from Iceland to Greenland,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
and formed there a settlement. Among his companions
was Herjulf Bardson, who fixed his residence at a place
which was called after him, Herjulfsness. Herjulf had a
son, whose name was Biarné, who, with his father, was
engaged in trading between Iceland and Norway. Biarné
was absent on a trading voyage, when his father accompanied
Eric, on the emigration of the latter to Greenland.
The son returning to Iceland in a few months, and finding
that Herjulf was absent, sailed in pursuit of him. In the
course of the sail, having been enveloped in the fogs, he
was carried to some unknown distance; but after the fogs
were dispersed, land was seen. As, however, it did not
answer the description given respecting Greenland, the
party did not steer for it. During a sail of several days,
they came in sight of land at two different times in succession;
and at last, tacking about, and carried by brisk and
favorable winds in a north-west direction, they reached the
coast of Greenland. This tradition of Biarné's voyage,
allowing it to be authentic, would seem to indicate that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
was carried far down on the coast of America, and passed
on his return the shores of <i>Newfoundland</i> and <i>Labrador</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

   <img src="images/illus-025.jpg" alt="Discovery of Labrador." title="Discovery of Labrador." />
   <p class="caption2">Discovery of Labrador.</p>
</div>

<p>In consequence of this adventure, and the interest which
the account of it excited, a voyage of exploration was projected,
and at length put into effect. It was conducted by
Leif, a son of Eric the Red, an adventurous rover, who
selected a company as adventurous as himself, among whom
was a German named Tyrker. It was in the year 1000 that
the voyage was made. After finding a shore in a direction
similar to that in which Biarné took, they landed, calling the
region <i>Helluland</i>, which was most probably <i>Labrador</i>. It
was an iceberg-lined shore, without grass or verdure. From
this spot they put out to sea, and, steering south, they came
to another coast, low like the first, but covered with thick
wood, except the portion immediately skirting the sea, which
consisted of white sand. It was probably <i>Nova Scotia</i>,
named by them, however, <i>Markland</i>, or <i>Woodland</i>. They
pursued their voyage for two days, under the favor of a
north-east wind, when they discovered land for the third
time. Here they disembarked on a part of the coast, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
was sheltered by an island. The face of the country was
found to be undulating, covered with wood, and bearing a
growth of fine fruits and berries. Taking to their vessel
again, they proceeded west in search of a harbor, which
they were so fortunate as to find. It was at the mouth
of a river proceeding from a lake. They first made the
river and then the lake; in the latter they cast anchor. In
this spot they erected huts in which to pass the winter.
When thus established, Leif made a division of his company
into two parties, for the purpose, on the one hand, of
watching the settlement, and, on the other, of exploring
the country.</p>

<p>In performing the latter service it happened, on one occasion,
that the German Tyrker, above named, failed to return
at night. After much anxiety and search, he was discovered,
having found during his wanderings a region which afforded
an abundance of grapes. The country, from this incident,
was named <i>Vinland</i> or <i>Wineland</i>. From the mention which
they made of the rising and the setting of the sun, at the
shortest day, it has been inferred that the island was <i>Nantucket</i>,
and the region called Vinland embraced the coast
of <i>Massachusetts</i> and <i>Rhode Island</i>. They returned to
Greenland the following season.</p>

<p>Thorwald, a brother of Leif, next undertook to make a
voyage, to the newly discovered land beyond the ocean.
This was in 1002. We need not mention the particulars,
but may state generally that the adventurers continued in
Vinland till the year 1004, and that the expedition terminated
unfortunately in the death of Thorwald. He was killed in a
skirmish with certain Esquimaux, with whom the party
came in contact in three several boats. Before breathing
his last, he gave directions as to the spot where they should
inter him. The rest returned to Greenland.</p>

<p>Following this adventure, the third son of Eric, named
Thornstein, embarked with his wife Gudrida, in search of
the body of Thorwald. But he never reached the country.
He was eventually driven back to Greenland, where he died.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>The next expedition seems to have been a project to colonize
the country. The vessels were three in number, on
board of which one hundred and forty men embarked, who
took with them all kinds of live stock. The leaders on this
occasion were Thorfinn, who married the widow of Thornstein,
Biarné Grimolfson, and Thorhall Gamlason. The
enterprise appears to have been attended with a measure
of success. They erected their tents, and fortified them in
the best manner they were able, as a protection against the
natives. An incident of some interest is mentioned as having
occurred in their trade with the latter. These were eager
for arms, but as they were not suffered to become an article
of barter, one of the natives seized an axe, and, in order to
test its efficacy, struck a companion with it, who was killed
on the spot. The affair shocked them exceedingly; but in
the midst of the confusion, the axe having been seized by
one who appeared to be a chief, was critically inspected for
a while, and then violently cast into the sea.</p>

   <p class="caption2">An Incident in the Camp of the Northmen.</p>
</div>

<p>The period of their continuance in Vinland was three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
years. They found it a beautiful country, while residing in
it. Thorfinn had a son born to him, whom he named Snorre,
the first child of European descent born on this continent,
the ancestor of many distinguished personages now living.
Among them is the noted sculptor Thorwaldsen. Thorfinn
and a part of his company returned at length to Iceland.
The remainder still continued in Vinland, where they were
afterwards joined by an expedition led by two brothers,
Helge and Finnboge, from Greenland. But this latter
enterprise ended tragically, a large number of the colonists
having been killed in a quarrel, which a wicked female
adventurer in the expedition had excited. A few other
voyages to Vinland, either accidental or designed, were
made by the Northmen during the eleventh and twelfth
centuries, some of them connected with attempts to propagate
Christianity among the natives, but no interesting
results are spoken of, and the whole project of colonizing
the new region seems to have been not only abandoned,
but to have passed from the minds of men. On the supposition
that the records are true, which in general may be
admitted, the colony could not have had a long continuance,
and it is certain that no remains of it have ever appeared,
unless some questionable accounts of the Jesuists, or the more
questionable inscriptions on Dighton-rock. It was not until
the era of Columbus that the world was awakened to the
enterprise, or even to the thought of discovering land beyond
the Western ocean. Whether he knew or did not know,
respecting the adventures of the Scandinavians in those
northern seas, it is hardly to be supposed that he could have
the remotest conception that the country they called Vinland
was the same as the Indies, which he proposed to reach
by sailing due west. The honor, first of his theory, and then
of his achievement, is therefore, in no degree diminished, by
the facts above narrated, so far as they may be believed to
be facts. He after all stands prëeminent among men, as
the discoverer of the new world. It was certainly, at that
period, new to European knowledge and adventure.</p>

<p>It is not ascertained in what year the birth of this illustrious
individual occurred. Some authorities have placed it
in 1446, others have removed it back eight or ten years
farther. As he died in 1506, and was said by Bernaldez, one
of his cotemporaries and intimates, to have departed "in a
good old age of seventy, a little more or less,"<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> it would
seem, abating the vagueness of the expression, that about
1436 was the period. The place of his birth also has been
a subject of controversy, but the evidence is decidedly in
favor of Genoa. His parentage was humble, though probably
of honorable descent. It is generally believed that his
father exercised the craft of a wool-carder or weaver.
Christopher was the eldest of four children, having two
brothers, Bartholomew and Diego, and one sister, who was
obscurely connected in life. In his early youth he was
instructed at Pavia, a place then celebrated for education,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
and is said there to have acquired that taste for mathematical
studies in which he afterwards excelled. Of geographical
science he was particularly enamored, as it became also
to be the favorite study of an adventurous age. It doubtless
gave a direction, in some measure, to the course which
Columbus pursued in life. At the early age of fourteen
years, he began to follow the seas, and after continuing this
profession for more than sixteen years, he proceeded to
Portugal, the country of maritime enterprise at that era.
Hither the adventurous spirits of Europe repaired, where
they sought their fortunes in this department of business.
Columbus mingled in the exciting scenes of the country
and the times. Sailing from thence, he continued to make
voyages to the various then known parts of the world, and
while on shore, he occupied his time in the construction and
sale of maps and charts. Thus furnished with all the nautical
science of the times, and with a large fund of experience,
he was prepared to enter upon those speculations,
respecting the possibility of lands lying beyond the western
waters, the result of which, when put into practice, proved
to be so auspicious to the interests of mankind. What will
not a single thought, when pursued as it may be, sometimes
effect! In our hero, it brought to light the existence of a
new world. His single object appeared to be, to find the
eastern shores of Asia, or some unknown tract, by sailing
due west.</p>

<p>How far that idea was original with him, it is not very
material to ascertain. If not the first individual to conceive
it, he was the first to carry it into execution. That land
existed beyond the Atlantic, was a conjecture merely of
the ancients. Seneca comes the nearest to a direct intimation,
though as a poetic fancy it claims no serious consideration.
As the idea is given by Frenau, he says:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The time shall come when numerous years are past,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The ocean shall dissolve the band of things,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And an extended region rise at last:<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
<span class="i1">And Typhis shall disclose the mighty land,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Far, far away, where none have roamed before:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Nor shall the world's remotest region be<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Gibraltar's rock, or Thule's savage shore,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Ferdinand Columbus informs us, that his father's conviction
of the existence of land in the west was founded on&mdash;1,
natural reason, or the deductions of science; 2, authority of
writers, amounting, however, to vague surmises; 3, testimony
of sea-faring persons, or rather popular rumors of
land, described in western voyages, embracing such relics
as appeared to be wafted from over the Atlantic to Europe.
What particular intimations he may have received, either
from authors or sailors, do not appear; since, in his voyage
to Iceland, no mention is made of his having learned the
story of the Scandinavian voyages to the northern portion
of America. It is possible, however, that he may have been
informed of them; and the reason why no mention was made
by him was, as M. Humboldt conjectures, that he had no
conception that the land discovered by the Northmen had
any connection with the region of which he was in pursuit.
The traditions which he may have met with, and the
speculations of the times, were realized in his view. So
strong was the conviction which had been wrought in his
mind, from whatever cause, he was willing to jeopard life
and fortune to put it to the test of experiment.</p>

<p>With this grand object before him, he first submitted his
theory of a western route to the Indies, to John the Second,
king of Portugal. He met with no countenance from this
quarter. His project, in its vastness, was in advance of the
comprehension of the age. John was not unwilling clandestinely
to avail himself of information communicated to
him by Columbus, but he would enter into no stipulation to
aid him in the enterprise. Leaving the court of Lisbon in
disgust, in the latter part of 1484, Columbus repaired to the
Spanish sovereigns, Ferdinand and Isabella. The time of
the application was peculiarly unfavorable, as the nation
was then in the midst of the Moorish war, and needed for
its prosecution all the pecuniary resources of the state.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
The persons of influence also in the court, were destitute
of those enlarged views, which are essential to a just appreciation
of the scheme that fired the great mind of Columbus.
With these causes of discouragement, and the submission
of his proposal on the part of the sovereigns to a council
chiefly of ecclesiastics, he had little reason to expect a
favorable issue. After waiting years in the most agitating
suspense and doubt (for the council would come to no
decision), he was preparing to abandon the suit. Pressing
the court for a definite answer at that juncture, they at last
gave him to understand, that his scheme was "vain, impracticable,
and resting on grounds too weak to merit the support
of the government." In deep despondency he quitted the
court, and took his way to the south, as if in desperation, to
seek other patronage in other quarters.</p>

<p>From the period of his application to the Spanish court,
to that at which we are now arrived in his history, it would
seem that he made several attempts to interest other distinguished
personages in his scheme, particularly the citizens
of his native Genoa; but the early authorities so disagree
among themselves, that the chronology of his movements,
previously to his first voyage, cannot be determined with
precision. It is certain, however, that while in the act of
leaving Spain, probably for the court of the French king,
from whom he had received a letter of encouragement, he
was purposely detained by a friend, Juan Perez, (who had
formerly been a confessor of Isabella,) for the purpose of
trying the effect of another application to the Spanish
sovereigns. This measure, seconded by the influence of
several distinguished individuals, and occurring just at the
triumphant termination of the Moorish war, had well nigh
proved successful at once; but Columbus was again doomed
to disappointment. The single obstacle in the way now,
was not the disinclination of Ferdinand and Isabella, but
what were deemed the extravagant demands of Columbus
himself. He would not consent to engage in the undertaking,
except on the condition that he and his heirs should receive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
the title of admiral and viceroy over all lands discovered
by him, with one-tenth of the profits. This demand was the
means of breaking up the negotiations, and that at the moment
when he seemed to be on the point of realizing the visions
which he had fondly indulged, through long years of vexation,
trouble, and disappointment. That he would consent to dash
those bright visions, rather than surrender one of the rewards
due to his service, is, in the language of our Prescott, "the
most remarkable exhibition in his whole life, of that proud,
unyielding spirit which sustained him through so many years
of trial, and enabled him to achieve his great enterprise, in
the face of every obstacle which man and nature had
opposed to it."</p>

   <p class="caption2">Columbus before Ferdinand and Isabella.</p>
</div>

<p>Columbus again having turned his back from the scene of
the negotiations, had proceeded only a few leagues distant,
when he was recalled by the royal message. The queen
in the meanwhile had yielded to the dictates of her own
noble and generous nature, having been convinced of the
importance of the enterprise, by the powerful representations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
of the friends of our hero. She said at once in answer,
"I will assume the undertaking for my own crown of Castile,
and will pledge my private jewels to raise the necessary
funds, if the means in the treasury should be found inadequate."
The money, however, was furnished by the receiver
of the revenues of Arragon, and subsequently refunded at
the instance of Ferdinand.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The conditions on which
Columbus had insisted, in the event of discovery, were
finally granted. He was constituted by the united sovereigns,
their admiral, viceroy, and governor-general, of all
such countries as he should discover in the Western ocean.
He was to be entitled to one-tenth of the products and
profits, within the limits of his discoveries. These, with
other privileges of a like kind, not necessary to name here,
were settled on him and his heirs for ever. Thus possessing
the royal sanction, Columbus immediately entered upon the
arrangements required to prosecute the voyage. Isabella
urged it forward to the extent of her power. Delay, however,
unavoidably occurred, on account of the opposition or
indifference of the local magistrates and the people where
the equipment was to be made. This obstacle was at length
removed, by stern edicts on the part of the government and
by the energy of Columbus. The fleet consisted of three
vessels, one furnished by himself, through the assistance of
his friends, and was to sail from the little port of Palos in
Andalusia. Two of the vessels were caravels&mdash;that is, light
vessels without decks&mdash;the other was of a larger burden,
though not amounting even to an hundred tons. How such
craft could survive the waves and storms of the Atlantic, is
one of the marvelous circumstances of the undertaking.
The number of men received on board amounted to one
hundred and twenty. The preparations having been
finished, the undaunted navigator set sail on the morning
of the 3d of August, 1492, having first with his whole crew
partaken of the sacrament.</p>

   <p class="caption2">Columbus sets sail.</p>
</div>

<p>He soon directed his course to the Canary islands, in
consequence of the condition of one of the vessels, called the
Pinta, whose rudder had been found to be unfit for service.
This, after a detention of more than three weeks, was
repaired, and they then, on the 6th of September, proceeded
on their voyage. On the fourth day, land ceased to be in
sight, and now the fearful reality of their condition pressed
upon the minds of the sailors with overpowering weight.
They had been pressed into the service, and from the
beginning were averse to the enterprise. Columbus had
reason, therefore, to expect the open manifestation of discontent,
if not insubordination and mutiny. The first
exhibition of their feelings, upon losing sight of land, was
that of alarm and terror. Many of them shed tears, and
broke out into loud lamentations&mdash;all before them seemed
to be mystery, danger, and death. It was by no means
easy to quell their fears, and it required all the address of
the admiral to effect it. Their minds were, in a degree,
soothed for that time by the promises of land and riches,
which he addressed to their wants or their cupidity. Every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
unusual incident, however, on the voyage, was calculated to
awaken their gloomy and distressing apprehensions, such as
the sight of a part of a mast, when they had sailed some
one hundred and fifty leagues, and the variation of the
needles. The former presented to their imagination the
probable wreck of their own frail barks. The variation of
the needle created surprise even in the mind of the admiral,
but to his crew the circumstance seemed perfectly terrific.
They felt as if the very laws of nature were undergoing a
change, and the compass was about to lose its virtues and
its power, as a guide over the waste of waters. Columbus,
however, by ascribing the variation of the needle to the
change of the polar-star itself, satisfied the minds of his
pilots, inasmuch as they entertained a high opinion of his
knowledge of astronomy. The distance at which they were
every day carried from their homes, was a source of accumulating
uneasiness. Every sort of superstitious fear was
indulged in. One while, the prevalence of winds from the
east, excited their apprehensions that a return to Spain was
impracticable. At another time, the slight south-west breezes
and frequent calms, causing the ocean to seem like a lake of
dead water, made them feel that they were in strange regions,
where nature was out of course, and all was different from
that to which they had been accustomed. Here they
thought they might be left to perish, on stagnant and boundless
waters. Now, they seemed to themselves to be in danger
of falling on concealed rocks and treacherous quicksands&mdash;then,
of being inextricably entangled in vast masses of seaweed
which lay in their path. Although Columbus had
contrived to keep his men ignorant of the real distance they
had come, yet the length of time could but tell them that they
must be far, very far from country and home, and that their
ever going on to the west, would at length place the east
too remote from them to hope ever reaching it. They had
been occasionally cheered with what were deemed indications
of their proximity to land, such as the flying of birds about
their fleet, the patches of weeds and herbs covering the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
surface of the water, and a certain cloudiness in the distant
horizon, such as hangs over land; but these had proved fallacious;
and the higher hope was raised by such appearances,
the deeper was its fall when the appearances passed away.</p>

<p>This state of things led to murmurs and discontent, and
at one time, the crew were on the point of combining in
open and desperate rebellion. The power which the great
admiral possessed over the minds of men, was never more
signalized, than in putting down this spirit of insubordination
and mutiny. He was perfectly aware of their intentions,
but preserved a serene and steady countenance. He
seemed intuitively to understand in what way to address
himself to the different portions of his company. Some, he
soothed with gentle words. Of others, he stimulated the
pride or avarice, by the offers of honors and rewards. The
most refractory he openly menaced with condign punishment,
should they make the slightest attempt at impeding
the voyage.</p>

<p>After the experience of long-continued calms, the wind
sprang up in a favorable direction, and they were enabled
efficiently to prosecute their voyage. This was on the
25th of September, and the vessels sailing quite near to
each other, a frequent interchange of conversation took
place on the subject most interesting to them&mdash;their probable
position as to land. In the midst of it, a shout from the
Pinta was heard on board the Santa Maria, the admiral's
ship, "Land, land!"&mdash;the signal pointing to the south-west.
Columbus, who had found cause on other occasions to dissent
from the opinions of his men, gave way, in this instance,
to the joyful feelings which were at once excited in their
bosoms: but it proved, at length, that what appeared to be
land, was nothing more than an evening cloud of a peculiar
kind. Thus were their hopes dashed, and nothing remained
for them but to press onward. Fain would the crew have
turned back upon their course, but the commander was
sternly resolute on realizing his magnificent project, and
pressed forward still deeper into mid-ocean.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>It is a necessary explanation of the character of this
extraordinary man, that he appeared all along to view himself
under the immediate guardianship of Heaven, in this
solemn enterprise. He consequently felt few or none of
the misgivings which so strongly affected his associates.
For several days longer they continued on, till on the 1st of
October, they had advanced more than seven hundred
leagues since the Canary islands were left behind. Again
the murmurs of the crew were renewed, but, in this instance,
became soon hushed by increasing tokens of their nearness
to land. Indeed, so sanguine were they on the subject,
that on the 7th of October, on board of the Nina, land was
again announced. But it proved a delusion, and all except
Columbus were ready to abandon hope. At the end of three
days more, they saw the sun, after renewed appearances
betokening their neighborhood to land, go down upon a
shoreless horizon. At this time the turbulence of the crew
became clamorous&mdash;they insisted upon turning homeward,
and abandoning the voyage as a forlorn hope. The commander
now, after trying to pacify them by kind words
and large promises, and trying in vain, arose in the majesty
of his undaunted heart, and gave them to understand that
all murmuring would be fruitless, and that, with God's blessing,
he would accomplish the purpose for which his sovereigns
had sent him on a voyage of discovery. Fortunately,
at this juncture, when the conduct of Columbus had become
nearly desperate, the indications of neighboring land could
not be mistaken. Besides fresh weed, the limb of a tree,
a reed, and a small board, they picked up an artificially
carved staff. Soon despondency and rebellion gave way
to hope, and, throughout the day, every person on board of
the little fleet was on the watch for the long-wished-for land.</p>

</div>

<p>The following evening was a time of intense anxiety to
Columbus. He could but infer that he was near to the goal
of his adventures and his hopes. But was it so indeed? That
was the question, and it must now be soon decided. Would
the night reveal it to him? Would its discoveries settle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
for ever the truth of his theory, and bring to him the immortal
honor which he sought, as the end of all his toil and
suffering? Taking his station in a conspicuous part of his
vessel, he maintained an intense and unremitting watch.
A few hours only had transpired, when suddenly he thought
he beheld a light glimmering at a great distance. One and
another was called to examine the appearance, in order to
confirm the commander in his impression, if indeed it was
correct. They gave their opinion in the affirmative. Soon,
however, the light disappeared, and few attached any importance
to it, except Columbus. They pursued their course
until two in the morning, when from the Pinta, which generally
sailed ahead, the thundering signal was heard, the order
being that a gun should be fired as soon as land hove in
sight. It was indeed land at this time. It lay before them,
now dimly seen, about two leagues distant. The joy which
Columbus and his crew felt at the sight, surpasses the power
of description. It is difficult, even for the imagination, to
conceive the emotions of such a man, in whose temperament<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
a wonderful enthusiasm and unbounded aspiration prevailed,
at the moment of so sublime a discovery. Utterance was
given to his intense feelings by tears, and prayers, and
thanksgivings.</p>

<p>It was on the morning of Friday, 12th of October, 1492,
that Columbus first saw the new world. A beautiful, fragrant,
verdure-crowned island lay before him, and evidently
populous, for the inhabitants were seen darting, in great
numbers, through the woods to the shore. That greenhouse
appearance, which the regions within the tropics are
known generally to assume, together with the purity and
blandness of the atmosphere, struck the senses of the voyagers,
as though it had been Eden itself. They could give
vent to their feelings only in tears of gratitude&mdash;in prayers
and praises to God, who had conducted them to such happy
destinies. Having made the necessary preparations, Columbus
landed with his crew on the delightful shore, in an
ecstasy of joy and devotion, taking possession of the whole
region in the name of his sovereigns, and calling the island
<i>San Salvador</i>. It proved to be one of what has since
been known as the Bahama islands.</p>

<p>The conduct and appearance of the natives were such as
to show that the Spaniards had no reason to fear their hostility
or treachery. Simple, harmless, naked, and unarmed,
they seemed rather to be at the mercy of their visitors.
Equally timid and curious, they were at first shy; but being
encouraged to approach the strangers, they at length became
entirely familiar with them, and received presents with
expressions of the highest delight. The new comers to
their shores were thought to have dropped from the skies,
and the articles bestowed were received as celestial presents.
All was a scene of wonder and amazement indeed
to both parties.</p>

<p>As Columbus supposed himself to have landed on an
island at the extremity of India, he gave to the natives the
general appellation of Indians, by which, as a distinct race,
they have ever since been known.</p>

   <p class="caption2">Interview of Columbus with the Natives of Cuba.</p>
</div>

<p>After having noticed the features of the new-found island
sufficiently, and learned what he was able from the natives
in respect to other lands or islands, and particularly in
respect to the gold they might contain, he explored the
archipelago around, touched at several of the groups, and
finally discovered the larger and more distant islands of Cuba
and Hispaniola. Many interesting adventures occurred during
his sojourn among these islands, in his intercourse with
the natives, upon which we cannot enlarge. Suffice it to
say, that he succeeded according to his wishes in conciliating
the affections of the people, and in the extent of his discoveries
for the first voyage, but found a less amount of gold
than he expected, and was unfortunate in the shipwreck of
the Santa Maria, the principal vessel. His trials, also, with
several of his subordinates in office, were severe; as, on
more than one occasion, they proved unfaithful to his interests
and disobedient to his commands.</p>

   <p class="caption2">Columbus casting a barrel into the sea.</p>
</div>

<p>It was on the 4th of January, 1493, that Columbus set
sail for Spain. He left a part of his men in the island of
Hispaniola (Hayti, in the language of the original inhabitants),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
to occupy a fort he had built near a harbor, which
he had named <i>La Navidad</i>. While coasting on the eastern
side of the island, he met the Pinta, which had for
a time, under its disaffected captain, deserted from him.
Joined by this vessel again, they proceeded homeward
on their voyage; but they met with tempests, which their
frail barks were little able to encounter. The Pinta, being
separated from the Nina, was supposed to have been lost;
but this proved to have be a mistake, as she reached
Spain nearly at the same time with the other caravel.
At the time of their greatest extremity, when all hope
of safety had departed, Columbus, anxious that the knowledge
of his discovery might be communicated to the world,
wrote a brief account of his voyage; and having properly
secured it in a barrel, committed the latter to the
ocean, in the hope that it might afterwards be found, should
he and his crew never see land again.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> But they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
mercifully preserved, as the storm at length subsided, and,
within a few days, they reached the island of St. Mary's,
one of the Azores.</p>

<p>While he was at that island, where he had sought a refuge
for his wearied men and his own over-tasked body and mind,
he encountered a species of persecution most disgraceful
to civilized society. It was the result of the mean malignity
of the Portuguese, who were piqued that the honor of the
discovery should not have been secured for themselves, and
was manifested by the imprisonment of a portion of his crew,
and other vexatious treatment. At length, regaining his men,
he set sail for home; but, meeting with tempestuous weather,
he was forced to take shelter in the Tagus. Here astonishment
and envy seemed to be equally excited by the knowledge
of his discoveries; and, could certain courtiers of the
monarch have had their own way, the great adventurer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
would have been stricken down by the hand of the assassin.
So black a deed of treacherous villany had been advised.
The king, however, treated him with generosity, and Columbus
being dismissed with safety, soon found himself entering
the harbor of Palos, just seven months and eleven days since
his departure from that port.</p>

<p>His arrival in Spain excited the most lively feelings of
astonishment, joy, and gratitude. The nation was swayed
by one common sentiment of admiration of the man and
his exploits. Ferdinand and Isabella, who seemed to derive
so much glory from his success, most of all participated in
this sentiment. He was the universal theme, and most
amply was he indemnified by the honors now bestowed upon
him, and the enthusiasm with which he was every where
welcomed, for all the neglect and contumely he had previously
suffered, as a supposed insane or fanatical projector.
His progress through Spain was like the triumphal march
of a conqueror. But it is impossible, within the limited
compass of this narrative, to present any thing like an adequate
idea of the sensation which was produced throughout
the nation and Europe at large, by the events that had thus
transpired, or to enumerate the hundredth part of the marks
of consideration, which "the observed of all observers"
received from prince and peasant&mdash;from the learned and
ignorant. The government confirmed anew to him all the
dignities, privileges, and emoluments for which he had
before stipulated, and others were added to them. But to
Columbus, the most satisfactory consideration accorded to
him by his sovereigns at this time, was the request to
attempt a second voyage of discovery. For this, the preparations
were on a scale commensurate to the object
in view.</p>

<p>The complement of the fleet amounted to fifteen hundred
souls. Among these were many who enlisted from love of
adventure or glory, including several persons of rank, hidalgos,
and members of the royal household. The squadron
consisted of seventeen vessels, three of which were of one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
hundred tons burden each. With a navy of this size, so
strongly contrasting with that of his former voyage, he
took his departure from the Bay of Cadiz on the 25th of
September, 1493. He sailed on a course somewhat south
of west, instead of due west as before, and after being upon
the sea one month and seven days, he came to a lofty island,
to which he gave the name of Dominica, from having discovered
it on Sunday. The liveliest joy was felt by the
numerous company, and devout thanks were returned to
God for their prosperous voyage.</p>

<p>Sad reverses, however, awaited the great commander
during this voyage of discovery. The garrison which he
had left on the island of Hispaniola had disappeared, and
the natives seemed less favorably disposed towards the
white man than at first&mdash;a change which probably accounts
for the fate of the garrison. Columbus, indeed, added other
islands to the list of those before known, planted stations
here and there on the principal island above named, and
showed his usual unequaled energy and skill in the conduct
of the expedition. But, as he could not be every where at
once, his absence from a place was the sure signal of misrule
and insubordination among that class of adventurers
who had never been accustomed to subjection or labor.
His cautious and conciliating policy in the treatment of the
natives was abandoned, where he could not be present to
enforce it, and, the consequence was, that they were aroused
to resentment, on account of the injuries inflicted upon them.
The treatment of the female natives, on the part of the
colonists, was of that scandalous character calculated to
produce continual broils and collisions. Eventually, a fierce
warlike spirit was excited among portions of this naturally
gentle and timid people; but they proved to be unequal to
the civilized man, with the superior arms and discipline of
the latter, in hostile encounter, and were driven before him
as the leaves of autumn before a storm. There was such
a war of extermination, that, in less than four years after
the Spaniards had set foot on the island of Hispaniola, one-third<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
of its population, amounting probably to several hundred
thousand, was destroyed.</p>

<p>Complaints were made by the colonists against the administration
of Columbus, so that eventually he felt the necessity
of returning home to vindicate his proceedings. Ferdinand
and Isabella, however, took no part with the malcontents
against him. They treated him with marked distinction;
but it was evident that with the novelty of his discoveries,
the enthusiasm of the nation had passed away. It was
generally felt to be a losing concern. The actual returns
of gold and other products of the new world were so
scanty, as to bear no proportion to the outlays.</p>

<p>A third expedition was projected, and after various hindrances,
arising from the difficulty of meeting the expense,
and the apathy of the public, Columbus took his departure
from the port of St. Lucas, May 30, 1498. Proceeding in
a still more southerly direction than before, on the 1st of
August following, he succeeded in reaching <i>terra firma</i>.
He thus entitled himself to the glory of discovering the
great southern continent, for which he had before prepared
the way.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to detail the events of this expedition,
except to say, that it proved a source of untold evil and
suffering to the veteran navigator. After his arrival at
Hispaniola, he was involved in inextricable difficulties with
the colonists, the final result of which was, that he was
sent home in chains. This shocking indignity was the
unauthorized act of a commissioner, named Boadilla, sent
out by the government to adjust the differences that had
taken place. The king and queen of Spain thus became
unwittingly the cause of his disgrace. This was too much
for the kind and generous feelings of the queen in particular.
Columbus was soothed by the assurances of her
sympathy and sorrow for his trials. "When he beheld the
emotion of his royal mistress, and listened to her consolatory
language, it was too much for his loyal and generous heart;
and, throwing himself on his knees, he gave vent to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
feelings, and sobbed aloud."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> As an indication of the continued
confidence of the king and queen in his fidelity,
wisdom, and nautical skill, they proposed to him a fourth
voyage. To this he assented, with some reluctance at first;
but, cheered by their assurances, he quitted the port of
Cadiz on the 9th of March, 1502, with a small squadron of
four caravels. This was his last voyage, and more disastrous
than any which preceded it. Among other misfortunes,
he was wrecked on the island of Jamaica, where he
was permitted to linger more than a year, through the
malice of Ovando, the new governor of St. Domingo. On
his return, the 7th of November, 1504, after a most perilous
and tedious voyage, he was destined to feel the heaviest
stroke of all, in the death of his most constant and liberal
supporter, the queen; and, with her death, to fail of that
public justice which he had looked for as the crown of all
his labors, hardships, and sacrifices. The king, always
wary and distrustful, though he treated Columbus with high
public consideration, seems to have regarded him "in the
unwelcome light of a creditor, whose demands were never
to be disavowed, and too large to be satisfied." The great
discoverer lived only a year and a half after his return;
and, though poorly compensated by the king in his last
days, he bore his trials with patience, and died on the 5th
of May, 1506, in the most Christian spirit of resignation.</p>

<p>Although the evidence of history establishes the claim
of Columbus, as the first discoverer of the new world,
including in that term the West Indian archipelago, yet
there were other meritorious voyagers, who extended the
knowledge of these new regions, thus laid open to mankind.
Others there were, who, stimulated by his success, and following
his steps, enlarged the boundaries of geographical
science even beyond the actual discoveries of Columbus.
Among these voyagers was the admirable Sebastian Cabot,
whose merits have never been fully acknowledged as they
deserved to be, having been overlooked, in a measure,
through the greater admiration bestowed on his predecessor.
He belonged to a family distinguished for their spirit of
adventure, as his father before him was an eminent navigator,
and he was associated with two brothers, apparently
possessing the same love of a sea-faring life. The father
of Sebastian was an Italian, but the son was born in Bristol,
England, in 1477. The family was fitted out with five
ships, for the purpose of discovery, by the English government,
who granted a patent, under date of March 6th, 1496,
to John Cabot, the father, as leader of the expedition. He
was, however, rather the overseer or adviser of the concern,
than the leader. The real conductor of it was Sebastian,
who, through his modesty, failed to secure for himself
that consideration from the world which was his due.</p>

<p>His object, like that of Columbus, was to find a passage to
India; but not in the direction which the latter took. The
idea which possessed the mind of Cabot was, that India
might be reached by sailing <i>north-west</i>. He left Bristol in
the spring of 1497, and on the 24th of June, in pursuing his
course, he came unexpectedly, and to his disappointment, in
sight of land, and was thus impeded as to his progress in
that direction. It was the North American continent which
he had approached. The land seen was the coast of Labrador,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
as also an island that received the name of St. John's
island, from the day on which it was discovered. Cabot
has recorded, in all simplicity, how the affair happened.
He supposed himself to be on the direct route to India,
"but, after certayne dayes," said he, "I found that the land
ranne towards the north, which was to mee a great displeasure."
St. John's island he describes as "full of white
bears, and stagges far greater than the English." From
this point he steered his course towards the bay since called
Hudson's bay; but, after several days' sailing, he yielded
to the discontent of the crew, and returned to England.</p>

<p>Cabot conducted a second expedition, which sailed from
Bristol in 1498. He reached Labrador again, where he
left a portion of his crew, in order to commence a colony,
while he proceeded on his voyage. But success did not
reward his attempt, and, on his return to Labrador, he
found the colonists, from the sufferings they had experienced
in that cold and sterile region, clamorous for a return. He
accordingly submitted to their demands, and, laying his
course to the south as far as the Cape of Florida, he
rëcrossed the ocean. The notes which he took of his
voyage have unhappily been lost.</p>

<p>In 1517 he was again employed, in an expedition from
England; but though he penetrated to about the sixty-seventh
degree of north latitude, and entered Hudson's bay, giving
names to various places in the vicinity, he was compelled to
return, through the cowardice of an officer high in command,
Sir Thomas Pert, and the disaffection of the crew. They
had not the spirit to encounter the rigor and privations of
the climate.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these and his subsequent services for his
country, he was suffered in the end to fall into poverty and
neglect. His life was filled with adventures and changes.
For several years he was employed in the service of the
king of Spain, and during one of the expeditions on which
he was sent from that country, he made the important discovery
of the Rio de la Plata. He occasionally returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
to England, and at length made it his resting-place. Gloom
overshadowed his latter days. His pension, at the accession
of Mary, was suspended for two years, and, though restored,
it was diminished the one-half. He survived to a great age,
being over eighty years, dying as is supposed in London, but
<i>when</i> no record shows. Not the slightest memorial points
out the place of his sepulture.</p>

<p>It is quite certain that the date of Cabot's discovery of
the Western continent is more than one year anterior to that
of Columbus, the latter having reached the southern portion
of it August 1st, 1498, while Cabot reached the northern
portion June 24th, 1497. Amerigo Vespucci, who has
carried away the honor of giving name to the continent, did
not reach it until nearly two years after the English adventurer.
But Columbus, in his first voyage, having ascertained
the existence of regions beyond the Atlantic, became in
effect the earliest and real discoverer. Except for his sublime
theory and adventurous experiment, the age, probably,
would not have furnished a Sebastian Cabot or an Amerigo
Vespucci.</p>

<p>When the new world, as America has since been familiarly
called, was opened to the enterprise and cupidity of
Europeans, it became an object to effect settlements in it
from time to time. Accordingly, during a period of more
than one hundred years from the discovery of San Salvador
by Columbus, attempts were made for this purpose,
either by adventurers in search of other discoveries, or by
expeditions fitted out to occupy regions already known. So
far, however, as the northern portion of the continent was
concerned, these attempts proved entirely without success.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
There was no want of excitement and effort at this remarkable
era, on the part of <i>individuals</i>. The strange story of
the voyages of Columbus awakened the spirit of adventure
in Europe, as it was never felt before. Vessel after vessel,
and fleet after fleet, were despatched to the new-discovered
continent, but the object in view was rather to find gold
than a home; and even where the latter was sought, the
preparations were either inadequate, or the undertaking
was indifferently contrived and managed. Sebastian Cabot,
who discovered Newfoundland; James Cartier, who first
entered the Gulf of St. Lawrence; Ferdinand de Soto,
who first ascertained the existence of the Mississippi; Sir
Walter Raleigh, among the earliest adventurers to Virginia,
and Bartholomew Gosnold, to whom Cape Cod was first
known, and all of whom attempted settlements for a longer
or shorter period, were unsuccessful, and disappointed in the
end. The English were not thoroughly engaged in the
business of colonizing America, until the latter part of the
sixteenth century, when several successive attempts were
made to settle Virginia. The first expedition was conducted
by Sir Humphrey Gilbert, who failed in his object, having
never reached Virginia; and being shipwrecked, perished
with all his crew on the return voyage to England. In
1584, the enterprise was confided to the auspices of Sir
Walter Raleigh, who, in the spring of that year, despatched
two small barks, under the command severally of Amidas
and Barlow. After going much farther south than was
necessary, and experiencing the sickness incident to the
season, they proceeded northerly till they made a harbor,
taking possession of the adjoining land, "for the queen's
most excellent majestie," and in a short time afterward came
to the island of Roanoke. Nothing was effected by this
voyage, except a little trafficking with the natives, and the
favorable account which was given of the country, upon the
return of the expedition. In the third expedition, which
was conducted by Sir Richard Grenville, under Sir Walter,
in 1585, a company was landed on Roanoke, consisting of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
one hundred and eight persons, who, upon the return of the
ship, were left to settle the country. But being reduced to
extremities for want of sustenance, and by the hostility of
the Indians, they all returned to England the next year with
Sir Francis Drake. In the mean while, 1585, Sir Walter
Raleigh and his associates made a voyage to Virginia,
taking supplies for the colony; but after spending some time
in the country, and not finding the colonists, they returned
to England.</p>

   <p class="caption2">Early Settlers trading with the Natives.</p>
</div>

<p>In the earlier attempts at settlement, after the spirit of
conquest and adventure had been somewhat satiated, the
object in view, so far as the English were engaged in
it, was the acquisition of tributary provinces, and the
wealth which they would bring to the parent states. In
this line of policy, England but followed the example of
Spain and Portugal, yet with far less energy, and with no
manner of success. The signal failures that were experienced
turned attention, at length, to more sober and
rational projects&mdash;to regular colonization and commerce.
But the success, even here, was quite indifferent for several
years. Mercenary views obtained the precedence. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
moral heroism, which submits to any extremity of toil and
self-denial for the objects of religious faith, could not be
summoned to the support of these merely secular adventures.
So far as colonization was calculated upon as a
source of wealth directly, it did not feel the influence of
a self-sustaining motive. It needed, as will soon be seen,
other views of colonization, to render the scheme completely
successful, in regions remote from tropical riches
and luxuries. What more might have been done to insure
success, had the kings and princes of Europe been at
leisure to prosecute the object with the means in their
power, is not now to be ascertained. It is clear, from the
history of the times, that they could ill afford the necessary
leisure, in consequence of the multiplicity and weight of
their own individual concerns. Wars, negociations, schemes
of policy, and the adjustment of ecclesiastical relations,
occupied the rulers of England and France, as also Germany
and nearly all the continent, almost exclusively
through the sixteenth century. Of that which was achieved
in the way of discovery and temporary settlement, in the
northern portion of the American continent, much was left
to individual enterprise and resources; and the universal
failure of permanent colonization was almost the unavoidable
result, connected, indeed, with the mercenary motive
and bad management with which it was prosecuted.</p>

<p>The first settlement of a permanent character, effected
by the English in North America, was at <i>Jamestown</i>, in
Virginia, in 1607. To that portion of the continent, as has
been just detailed, more numerous and vigorous efforts at
settlement had been directed than to any other on the
coast, and with what results has also appeared. No one can
read the account of these early and unfortunate attempts to
settle our country, without deeply lamenting the fate of
those brave adventurers who were engaged in them. In
the Virginia enterprise, religion and its blessings were not
the direct moving influences on the minds of the adventurers;
but they were a gallant and public spirited class of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
the English people, and many of them of the better orders
of society.</p>

<p>Their failure, however, did not check the spirit of enterprise;
a settlement was determined on, and it was providentially
effected. Under the sanction of a grant from
King James, of the southern equal half of the territory
lying between the thirty-fourth and forty-fifth degrees of
latitude, an association was constituted, called the London
Company, who undertook the colonization of their portion
of the country. This was called the <i>Southern Colony</i>.
The expedition consisted of three small vessels, under the
command of Captain Christopher Newport, a man of great
nautical experience. Neither they who were designed for
the magistracy, nor the code of laws, could be known until
the arrival of the fleet in Virginia, when the sealed orders,
committed to the commander, might be broken. It would
seem, from the early accounts, that a portion of the emigrants
were but little influenced by the considerations of
religion or propriety, from the disorders that occurred during
the voyage; but their pious preacher, Mr. Hunt, at length,
"with the water of patience and his godly exhortations (but
chiefly by his true-devoted examples) quenched these flames
of envy and dissension."</p>

<p>In searching for Roanoke, they were driven by a storm
to a different part of the coast; the first land they made
being a cape, which they called Cape Henry. Thus discovering
and sailing up the Chesapeake bay, they came, at
length, to a place suited to their purpose. Here they commenced
in earnest their great work of settlement, calling
the place <i>Jamestown</i>, in honor of King James. According
to directions, the box containing the orders was opened, and
the names of Bartholomew Gosnold, John Smith, Edward
Wingfield, Christopher Newport, John Radcliffe, John Martin,
and George Kendall, were found as constituting the
council. These were to choose a president from among
themselves, for a year, who, with the council, should conduct
and govern the colony. Mr. Wingfield was elected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
president, while one of the most distinguished of them,
Captain John Smith, on account of suspicions entertained
respecting his ambitious views, was excluded, for a time,
from the council. The plan of government was, that
matters of moment were to be examined by a jury, but
determined by the major part of the council, in which the
president had two votes.</p>

<p>While erecting accommodations for themselves, and
during the absence of a portion of the men on discoveries
in the country, they were molested by the savages, with
some small loss, and were in danger of total extirpation,
"had it not chanced that a crosse-barre, shot from the ships,
stroke down a bough from a tree amongst them (the savages),
that caused them to retire." These, it seems, on
other occasions, after troubling the planters, "by the nimbleness
of their heeles, escaped." What with labor by day,
and watching by night&mdash;with felling trees, and planting the
ground&mdash;with resisting hostile attacks, rëloading ships, and
effecting governmental business&mdash;the settlers found their
hands and their hearts fully, and often painfully, occupied.
Several weeks were spent in this manner, and after adjusting
their disputes, and receiving Smith into the council,
with a handsome remuneration for the wrong he had
received, they all partook of the Holy Communion, the
savages at the same time desiring peace with them. On
the 15th of June, 1607, Captain Newport returned to
England with the intelligence of their success, leaving in
Virginia one hundred emigrants.</p>

<p>The departure of Newport was the signal for want, and
an increase of their difficulties. While the vessels were
with them, provisions, at some rate, were to be had; but
after they left, "there remained neither taverne, beere-house,
nor place of reliefe, but the common kettell. Had we beene
as free from all shine as gluttony and drunkenness, we might
have been cannonized for saints&mdash;we might truly call it (the
damaged grain) so much bran than corne, our drink was
water, our lodgings castles in the air: with this lodging and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
diet, our extreme toil, in bearing and planting pallisadoes,
so strained and bruised us, and our continual labor, in the
extremity of the heat, had so weakened us, as were cause
sufficient to have made us miserable in our native country,
or any other place in the world."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> This was truly a hard
lot&mdash;through the summer they lived on the products of the
sea. During that time, they buried fifty of their number.
At the point, however, of their greatest scarcity, they were
happily supplied with fruit and provisions by the Indians.</p>

<p>Their difficulties were greatly increased by the perverseness
or incapacity of several of their council. In this body,
changes and deposals took place from time to time, until the
management of every thing abroad, fell into the hands of
Captain Smith. Of this extraordinary man, much might be
related, were there space; but we can pursue only the course
of events as they occurred in the settlement of this country.
In the mean while, by his energy and example in labor,
"himselfe alwayes bearing the greatest taske for his own
share," he set the men effectually to work in providing for
themselves comfortable lodgings. This done, the necessity
of procuring a more permanent supply of provisions, and of
receiving the friendship of the natives, or subjecting them
to the power of the colonists, engaged him for a period in
the most daring projects. In this, he passed through a
wonderful vicissitude of fortune&mdash;the colony in the mean
while sustaining a precarious existence, by means of the dissensions
that prevailed, the hostility of the Indians, and the
sickness that wasted the whites. On one occasion, while
exploring the country, after he left his boat, and was proceeding
in company with two Englishmen, and a savage for
his guide, he was beset with two hundred savages. The
Englishmen were killed; the savage he tied to his arm with
his garter, using him as a buckler. Smith was soon wounded
and taken prisoner; but not until he had killed three of the
Indians. The fear inspired by his bravery checked their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
advance, till he sunk to the middle in a miry spot which
was in his way, as he retreated backward. Even then they
dared not come near him, till, being nearly dead with cold,
he threw away his arms. Upon being taken, he presented
to their king a round ivory compass, which was the means
of saving him from instant death. Just as they were
preparing to pierce him with their arrows, the chief, lifting
the compass, they all laid down their bows and arrows, at
the same time releasing him from his pitiable situation.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="illus-058.jpg" id="illus-058.jpg"></a>
   <img src="images/illus-058.jpg" alt="Smith saved from Death." title="Smith saved from Death." />
   <p class="caption2">Smith saved from Death.</p>
</div>

<p>At length he was brought to Powhatan, their emperor.
It soon became evident that they were preparing to put
him to death after their peculiarly fantastic and barbarous
ceremonies. A long consultation was held, and the conclusion
was, "two great stones were brought before Powhatan,
then as many as could lay hands on him dragged him to
them, and thereon laid his head; and being ready with their
clubs to beate out his brains, <i>Pocahontas</i>, the king's dearest
daughter, when no entreaty could prevail, got his head into
her armes, and laid her owne upon his, to save him from
death: whereat the emperor was contented he should live."</p>

<p>Friendship with the whites soon followed this event.
Smith was taken to Jamestown by his guides, and contracts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
were made with the Indians by means of presents, which
secured a portion of their territory to the English. Every
few days, Pocahontas with her attendants brought to Captain
Smith provisions in such quantity as to save the lives of the
colonists.</p>

<p>This condition of things could not always last: the support
thus received could be but precarious at the best; and
it happened favorably that, for a period, the spirits and
courage of the small band of emigrants were sustained by
the arrival of two ships from England, laden with supplies,
and bringing a complement of men. They arrived indeed
at different times, having been separated by stormy weather.
In consequence of these arrivals, and one other before the
end of the year 1608, the number of colonists amounted to
nearly three hundred.</p>

<p>In 1609, a new charter was granted to the London
company, with enlarged privileges, as well as more definite
limits, and with the addition of five hundred adventurers.
Sir Thomas West, Lord De la War, was now appointed
governor for life; Sir Thomas Gates, his lieutenant; Sir
George Somers, admiral; and other high officers were
appointed for life. By the new charter, the right of absolute
property was vested in the company; the crown to
receive one-fifth of all ore of gold and silver found there
for all manner of services. The governor, though unable
himself immediately to leave England, lost no time in fitting
out a fleet for Virginia. Of the nine ships constituting the
expedition, eight arrived in season at Jamestown. The
other, having Sir Thomas, the admiral, on board, was
wrecked on the Bermudas; and it was not until they could
fit up craft to convey them to Virginia, that they reached
Jamestown, which was in the spring of the following year.
This disaster and delay seemed to be highly providential in
the end, as the colonists were rëunited with one hundred
and fifty men, and a full supply of provisions, at a time
when they had been reduced to the greatest extremities.
Captain Smith, disabled by a severe accidental wound, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
returned to England. In consequence of his departure, the
settlement had been thrown into great confusion. Complaints,
disputes, and insubordination ensued; the savages
became hostile, and often imbrued their hands in the blood
of the whites; and finally, starvation followed in the train
of the other calamities. Roots, herbs, acorns, walnuts,
starch, the skins of horses, and even human flesh, were
devoured in order to support life. In a few days more, had
not relief been brought to them, the whole colony would
probably have perished.</p>

<p>On the arrival of Sir Thomas, the affairs of the settlement
seemed so desperate, that it was determined to return with
the miserable remnant to England. In putting the plan into
execution, and just as they were leaving the mouth of the
river, the long-boat of Lord De la War was descried. As
he had three ships well furnished with provisions, the colonists
were persuaded to return, and renew their efforts to
settle the country. This was on the 9th of June, 1610, and
proved to be the crisis of the colony. It was now, in the
providence of God, destined to live. Improvements began
to be made&mdash;forts were erected&mdash;and the former idleness
and misrule of the people in a great measure disappeared.
In the spring of the succeeding year, however, the health
of Lord De la War became seriously affected, and he consequently
returned to England. The administration was
then committed to Sir Thomas Dale for a short period.
He acquitted himself well in it, though he had some difficulty
with the colonists, who had not all been reduced to
the requisite order and submission. The government passed
into the hands of Sir Thomas Gates, upon his arrival at
Jamestown, in August, 1611. He came over with a fleet
of six ships, and three hundred men, bringing with him kine
and other cattle, munitions of war, and a large supply of
provisions.</p>

<p>Being thus strengthened, the English extended their
domain from time to time. In the course of the present
year, they built a town, which they called Henrico, in honor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
of Prince Henry, and in the subsequent year, they seized a
place called Apamatuck, on account of some injury they
had received from its inhabitants. Here they built a town,
which they called the <i>New Bermudas</i>. About this period,
a Captain Argal, sailing up the Patawomeakee, secured
Pocahontas by stratagem; the consequence of which was,
her acquaintance with an English gentleman, named John
Rolfe, and her marriage to him, together with peace between
the whites and Powhatan.</p>

<p>The plan of providing for the colony was now changed.
Instead of feeding out of the common store, and laboring
jointly together, the people were allowed to hold each a
lot of his own, with a sufficient time to cultivate it. This
change produced the most beneficial results, as it prevented
the idleness and inefficiency which are apt to attend a common-stock
social establishment, and multiplied, in a ten-fold
degree, the amount of their provisions. The experiment
having been so propitious, the original plan of a community
of labor and supply was finally abandoned. The government
of the colony at this time was again in the hands of
Sir Thomas Dale; the former governor, Sir Thomas Gates,
having returned to England in the spring of 1614. Governor
Dale continued about two years, superintending satisfactorily
the affairs of the colony, and, having chosen Captain
George Yeardley to be deputy-governor, he returned to
England, accompanied by Pocahontas and her husband.
Pocahontas became a Christian and a mother; and it may be
added, that her descendants, in a subsequent age, inherited
her lands in Virginia, and that some of the first families of
that state trace from her their lineage.</p>

<p>Yeardley applied himself to the cultivation of tobacco,
and was highly successful in an attack on the savages, who
refused to pay their annual tribute of corn. He continued
in the colony about a year, when, by an appointment made
in England, the government devolved on Captain Argal,
before named. Argal found Jamestown in a bad condition;
the dwellings, which were slight structures, had mostly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
disappeared, and the public works neglected or in decay,
and "the colonie dispersed all about, planting <i>Tobacco</i>."
A reformation to some extent was effected. At this period,
1617, more colonists arrived; but it would seem, from a
remark in a narrative of that date, that the number of the
higher classes of society exceeded their wants; "for, in Virginia,
a plaine souldier, that can use a pickaxe and spade,
is better than five knights, although they were knights that
could break a lance; for men of great place, not inured to
those encounters, when they finde things not suitable, grow
many times so discontented, they forget themselves, and oft
become so carelesse, that a discontented melancholy brings
them to much sorrow, and to others, much miserie." When
it was ascertained that great multitudes were preparing, in
England, to be sent, the colonists, in a communication to
the council, entreated that provisions might be forwarded
as well as people, and gave the company to understand,
"what they did suffer for want of skilful husbandmen and
meanes to set their plough on worke, having as good land
as any man can desire."</p>

<p>In the year 1619, the settlements of Virginia were favored
with the establishment of a provincial legislature, which
was constituted of delegates chosen by themselves, as they
were divided into eleven corporations. The first meeting
of the legislature was on the 19th of June, having been
convoked by the governor-general of the colony. This
was a great and desirable change from the sort of vassalage
in which they had previously lived. This general assembly
debated and decided all matters that were deemed essential
to the welfare of the colony. A great addition was
made to the number of the colonists the two following years,
among whom were one hundred and fifty young women, of
good character, designed as the future wives of the colonists.
During the summer of 1620, a Dutch armed ship
arrived at the colony, and sold them twenty negroes, at
which period the system of slave holding, with its attendant
crimes and evils, commenced in this country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>The year 1621 was rendered memorable by the arrival
of Sir Francis Wyatt, who brought with him, from the
London company, a more perfect constitution and form
of government, than the colony had previously enjoyed,
although the general representative character of its government
had been established in 1619. The following year
was rendered still more memorable by the massacre of a
large number of whites, through the treachery of the
Indians. The instigator and executor of this tragedy was
the successor of Powhatan, named Opecancanough. He
had enlisted the savages in all the vicinity in the infernal
plot. The colonists, in the security of friendship and good
understanding, which had existed between them and that
people, were wholly off their guard, and unprepared for the
blow. It was inflicted simultaneously, at a time agreed
upon, and three hundred and forty-seven men, women, and
children, were at once butchered, in several and separate
places. It had been universal, but for the providence of
God. A converted Indian, coming to the knowledge of the
plot the night before its execution, disclosed it to the whites
in season to save the greater number of settlements. The
Indians, in their turn, now suffered the vengeance of the
colonists, who felt authorized to procure the means of future
security against similar acts of treachery. The emigrations
had been so numerous, through the few preceding years, that
the colonists, at this time, amounted to several thousands.
Thus the people, with various fortune, and after incredible
hardships, had placed their colony on a firm basis, having
learned many useful lessons from their own errors, imprudence,
or sufferings. And such was the beginning of the
American republic in its southern portion, nearly two hundred
and fifty years ago.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plymouth</span>&mdash;Massachusetts&mdash;Connecticut&mdash;New Haven&mdash;New Hampshire&mdash;Rhode
Island&mdash;Maine&mdash;Vermont&mdash;Character of the Early Settlers.</p></blockquote>

<p>The settlement of <i>New England</i> commenced at Plymouth
in 1620. This part of the continent between Penobscot and
Cape Cod, had been carefully explored in 1614, by Captain
Smith. He says, respecting it: "Of all the foure parts of the
world I have yet seen not inhabited, could I have but means
to transport a colony, I would rather live here than any
where; and if it did not maintaine itselfe, were we but once
indifferently well fitted, let us starve." Such was the opinion
early formed of the desirableness of this region for colonization.
Charles, Prince of Wales, was pleased to call it New
England, on account of the favorable impression he received
respecting it, from Smith's chart and description. This
country was settled by a class of people very different, in
many respects, from that which emigrated to the southern
colony. The latter, for the most part, as has been seen, were
mere adventurers, having in view the improvement of their
secular interests, or the <i>eclat</i> of successful enterprise. The
colonists of New England sought chiefly the boon of religious
freedom for themselves and their descendants, and through
it the advancement of the Christian church in the world&mdash;a
boon of which they had been deprived in their native land.
The ground of this disfranchisement, was their non-conformity
to the established English church, or separation from
it. Having, while members of that church, devised and
sought a greater purity in its worship without success, they
at length separated themselves from it, and formed a distinct
worshiping community. For thus professing to follow the
<i>pure</i> word of God, in opposition to traditions and human
devices, they were in derision termed <i>Puritans</i>. In the
progress of their religious views, and of the persecuting
spirit of the government, they passed from mere puritanism,
or efforts at greater purity in worship and in manners, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
non-conformity, and from non-conformity to dissent. From
difficulties in regard to the ritual of the church, they proceeded
to doctrines. The Puritans and the universities
denied a portion of the Apostles' Creed, so called: "advocated
the sanctity of the Sabbath and the opinions of
Calvin; his institutions being read in their schools, while
the Episcopal party took the opposite side, and espoused
the system of Arminius." Both under Elizabeth and James,
conformity was insisted on. The latter declared, "I will
have one doctrine, one discipline, one religion, in substance
and ceremony. I will make them conform, or I will hurry
them out of the land, or else worse." And he did hurry
out of the land many of those who had become obnoxious
to him; while the others were more cruelly hindered from
leaving the country, to suffer from contempt, poverty, or a
lingering death in imprisonment. Their attempts to escape
were frequently frustrated, and it was not without great
vexation and loss, that portions of this persecuted people
exiled themselves from their native country. Their first
place of refuge was Holland, where religious toleration had
been established by law. The leader of the emigrants, on
this occasion, was the able and pious Mr. John Robinson,
who has since been considered as the father of that portion
of the Puritans who were the founders of New England.
They successively left England, as many as found it in their
power, in the year 1606, and the two following years.
Their first place of residence was Amsterdam; but in 1609
they removed to Leyden, with a view to avoid some difficulties
that were felt or foreseen in the former place. Here
they were received with kindness, and continued several
years in a flourishing condition, under the faithful labors
of their pastor. In the mean while, notwithstanding their
general prospects, there were causes in operation which
rendered a change of location, in their case, extremely
desirable. These were the unhealthiness of the low
countries where they lived; the hard labors to which they
were subjected; the dissipated manners of the Hollanders,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
especially their lax observance of the Lord's day; the
apprehension of war at the conclusion of the truce between
Spain and Holland, which was then near at hand; the fear
lest their young men would enter into the military and naval
service; the tendency of their little community to become
absorbed and lost in a foreign nation; the natural and pious
desire of perpetuating a church, which they believed to be
constituted after the simple and pure model of the primitive
church of Christ, and a commendable zeal to propagate the
Gospel in the regions of the new world.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>In this situation, they turned their attention towards
America. Here they hoped to engage in their original
occupation of agriculture, and not merely to enjoy toleration,
but to form a society founded on their favorite plan of
ecclesiastical order. With this object in view, they first
applied to the Virginia company for a patent, who zealously
espoused their cause, but who were unable to obtain from
the king a toleration, under his seal, in religious liberty,
though he promised to wink at their heresy, provided they
should conduct themselves peaceably. The company
granted them permission to make a settlement near the
mouth of the Hudson river. They had previously, in the
want of adequate capital of their own for the founding of
a plantation, been enabled to interest several London merchants
in their scheme. These agreed to advance the necessary
sums, to be rëpaid out of the avails of their industry.
In this way, the emigrants were enabled to purchase the
Speedwell, a ship of sixty tons, and to hire in England the
Mayflower, a ship of one hundred and eighty tons, for the
intended expedition. The Mayflower alone came, as the
smaller vessel proved to be in a leaky condition, and, after
two several trials, she was dismissed, as unfit for the service.
The Mayflower took her departure on the 6th of September,
and, after a boisterous passage, they discovered the
land of Cape Cod on the 9th of November, at the break of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
day. The number of pilgrims, who had embarked, was
one hundred and one, not all who had proposed to come;
for the disasters that attended their setting out, had "winowed
their number of the cowardly and the lukewarm."
Their pastor, Mr. Robinson, did not leave Leyden, according
to an original agreement, that only a part of their company
should go to America to make provision for the rest.</p>

<p>The pilgrim voyagers found themselves on a bleak and
inhospitable coast, and much farther to the northward than
they intended to go. In agreement with their wishes, an
attempt was made, by the master of the ship, to proceed to
the Hudson. But either finding, or affecting to believe the
passage to be dangerous, he readily seized on the fears
which had been excited, probably by himself, to return to
the cape, with a view to make a landing there. It afterwards
appeared that he had been bribed by the Dutch, who
intended to keep possession of the Hudson river, to carry
the adventurers quite to the northward of their place of
destination. They arrived in Cape Cod harbor on the
11th of November, "and, being brought safe to land, they
fell upon their knees, and blessed the God of heaven, who
had brought them over the vast and furious ocean, and
delivered them from many perils and miseries." At this
time, "it was thought meet for their more orderly carrying
on their affairs, and accordingly by mutual consent they
entered into a solemn combination, as a body politic, to
submit to such government and governors, laws and ordinances,
as should by general consent from time to time be
made choice of and assented unto."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Forty-one persons
signed this compact. It contained the essential principles
of a free government, such as have since been embodied
in the institutions of republican America. John Carver
was immediately chosen their governor, "a man godly and
well-approved among them."</p>

<p>Severe were the trials which awaited this small and lone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
band of pilgrims. The necessity of selecting a more commodious
place for living was obvious, and, in the efforts
which were made for this purpose, several of them well
nigh perished. The excursions of an adventurous band of
men, on several occasions, were extremely hazardous; and,
though generally at the places where they landed, no
Indians were found, yet, in one instance, they came in
contact with the latter, and a hostile collision took place
between them. By the kind providence of God, however,
they were preserved. During one of their excursions into
the country, they found a quantity of corn, which they
took, with the intention of remunerating the owners, which
intention they were afterwards happily enabled to fulfil.
This was a providential discovery, which supplied their
present wants, and served as seed for a future harvest. An
entire month was occupied with these explorations. At
last, they found a tract where they concluded to consummate
their enterprise. Having sounded the harbor in front,
they ascertained it to be fit for shipping. Going on shore,
they explored the adjacent land, where they saw various
corn-fields and brooks. They then returned to the ship,
with the agreeable intelligence that they had found a place
convenient for settlement. This was on Monday, the 11th
of December, answering to the 22nd day, new style, the day
now celebrated in commemoration of the landing of the
pilgrims at <i>Plymouth</i>. The company had kept the Christian
Sabbath, the day before, on an island in the harbor.
The ship arrived at the newly-discovered port on the 16th.
Several days were spent in disembarking, and it was not
until the 25th that they began to build the first house. This
was a structure for common use, to receive them and their
goods. The undertaking, however, was preceded by united
prayer for Divine guidance. The building having been
completed, they began to erect "some cottages for habitation,
as time would admit, and also consulted of laws and
order, both for their civil and military government, as the
necessity of their present condition did require. But that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
which was sad and lamentable, in two or three months half
their company died, especially in January and February,
being the depth of winter, wanting houses and other comforts,
being infected with the scurvy and other diseases,
which their long voyage and their incommodate condition
brought upon them."<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Their reduction, by sickness, would
have rendered them an easy prey to the Indians; but the
providence of God had so ordered it, that but few of this
fierce people existed, at that period, in the neighborhood of
the settlers, and those few were kept back from inflicting any
injury, by the dread which had almost supernaturally, so to
speak, been inspired in their hearts. The paucity of the
Indians has been accounted for, from a wasting sickness, of
an extraordinary character, which had visited the region
some few years before.</p>

<p>Some time in March of 1621, an agreeable and unexpected
occurrence took place at the rendezvous of the
whites. It was a visit of an Indian sagamore, named<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
Samoset, with professions of friendship for them, and satisfaction
at their arrival in the country. His kind greeting
to them was, "Welcome, Englishmen! Welcome, Englishmen!"
He spoke in broken English, which he had learned
from English fishermen on the eastern coast. This was
an event of great consequence to the settlers, as they
learned from him many things in respect to the region
around, and the Indians that inhabited it. He came to the
English settlement again, with some other natives, and
advised the emigrants of the coming of the great sachem,
named Massasoit. In a short time this chief made his appearance,
in company with his principal associates, particularly
an Indian named Squanto, who proved to be of signal service
to the whites. He had learned the English language,
in consequence of having been carried to England by an
English adventurer. Mutual fear and distrust took place
between the parties, as Massasoit came in sight on the hill
which overlooked the place. After they each had taken
proper precautions against surprise, through the agency of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
Squanto they came together, and the result of the interview
was a league of peace, which was kept inviolate more
than fifty years.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="illus-070.jpg" id="illus-070.jpg"></a>
   <img src="images/illus-070.jpg" alt="Visit of Samoset to the English." title="Visit of Samoset to the English." />
   <p class="caption2">Visit of Samoset to the English.</p>
</div>

<p>The visit was not much prolonged. "Samoset and
Squanto stayed all night with us, and the king and all his
men lay all night in the wood, not above half an English
mile from us, and all their wives and women with them.
They said that within eight or nine days they would come
and set corn on the other side of the brook, and dwell there
all summer, which is hard by us. That night we kept good
watch, but there was no appearance of danger."<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> The
plantation at Plymouth enjoyed the benefit of Squanto's
presence with them, after the departure of the others. He
was a native or resident of the place, and almost the only
one that was left; and being acquainted with every part of
it, his information was made highly useful to the colonists.
They learned from him the method of cultivating corn, and
where to take their fish, and procure their commodities.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
He continued among them until the day of his death. In
the spring of 1621, Mr. Carver was confirmed as governor
for the succeeding year, but his death occurred soon afterwards.
Mr. William Bradford was chosen his successor,
and Mr. Israel Allerton his assistant. The intercourse of
the colonists with the Indians continued to be of a friendly
character, the former having, during the summer, made
several excursions into the country around, particularly one
to Shawmut (Boston), where they had an interview with
Obbatinnua, one of the parties to the submission signed a
short time before at Plymouth. He renewed his submission,
receiving, at the same time, a promise of defence
against his enemies.</p>

   <p class="caption2">Interview with Massasoit.</p>
</div>

<p>The small number of the colonists was increased before
the end of the year by an accession of thirty-five persons,
among whom was a very active and pious agent, Mr.
Robert Cushman. He became eminently useful to the
plantation. Upon the departure of the ship conveying this
latter company, the colony received a threatening token
from the Narraganset tribe of Indians&mdash;a circumstance
which induced them to fortify their little settlement as well
as they were able, and to keep a constant guard by day
and by night. Happily, no attempts at that time were
made to disturb their peace. This event occurred in the
year 1622. In the following year, a vigorous and successful
attempt, under the brave Captain Miles Standish, was
made to defeat a conspiracy formed by the Massachusetts
tribe, with several others, against a recent English settlement
at Wessagusset (Weymouth). This settlement had
been formed under Mr. Thos. Weston on his own account,
and consisted of sixty men. The slaughter of several of
the conspirators so terrified the Indian tribes concerned in
the conspiracy, that they fled from their homes into swamps
and desert places, where many of them perished. This
generous service, on the part of the Plymouth colony,
towards a neighboring plantation, redounded greatly to
their credit, especially as the latter were merely a company<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
of adventurers, and had been guilty of injustice towards
the Indians.</p>

<p>The present year proved to be a year of suffering, in
consequence of the scarcity of food. The following affecting
account is given by Bradford: "But by the time our
corn is planted, our victuals are spent, not knowing at night
where to have a bit in the morning; we have neither bread
nor corn for three or four months together, yet bear our
wants with cheerfulness, and rest on Providence. Having
but one boat left, we divide the men into several companies,
six or seven in each, who take their turns to go out with a
net, and fish, and return not till they get some, though they
be five or six days out; knowing there is nothing at home,
and to return empty would be a great discouragement.
When they stay long, or get but little, the rest go a digging
shellfish, and thus we live the summer; only sending one
or two to range the woods for deer, they get now and then
one, which we divide among the company; and in the winter
are helped with fowl and ground-nuts."<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> It is recorded
that, after a drought of six weeks, the government set apart
a solemn day of humiliation and prayer, which was almost
immediately followed by a copious supply of rain. In the
language of the chronicles of the times, it is thus spoken of:
"Though in the morning, when we assembled together, the
heavens were as clear, and the drought as like to continue
as it ever was, yet (our exercise continuing some eight or
nine hours) before our departure, the weather was overcast,
the clouds gathered together on all sides, and, in the morning,
distilled such soft, sweet, and moderate showers of rain,
continuing some fourteen days, and mixed with such seasonable
weather, as it was hard to say, whether our withered
corn or drooping affections were most quickened or revived,
such was the bounty and goodness of our God." Soon
after, in grateful acknowledgment of the blessing, a day of
public thanksgiving was observed. This, by a judicious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
historian, (Thomas Robbins, D. D.) is believed to be the
origin of the annual thanksgiving of New England.</p>

<p>Towards the close of the summer, two ships arrived at
Plymouth, bringing sixty emigrants, some of them the wives
and children of such as were already in the colony. Those
who came in the first three ships&mdash;the Mayflower, the Fortune,
and the Ann&mdash;are distinctively called the old comers,
or the <i>forefathers</i>. In 1624, Plymouth contained thirty-two
dwellings and about one hundred and eighty inhabitants.
Bradford was rëelected governor, and four assistants to
him were also chosen. To each person and his family an
acre of land was given in perpetuity. The first neat cattle
in New England were brought over this year by Edward
Winslow. The colonists had at that time no small trouble
with several of the new comers, particularly with one John
Lyford, a minister, and another by the name of Oldham,
who were disposed to act in opposition to the laws and
order of the colony. The persons above mentioned, however,
soon perished, Oldham having first become apparently
a penitent.</p>

<p>The congregation of the Puritans at Leyden was broken
up on the death of their pastor, Mr. Robinson, in 1627.
They desired to remove to New England, but only a part of
them were enabled to come. The others settled in Amsterdam.
Mr. Robinson had hoped to emigrate, but the expense
of the undertaking could not well be met, and his death
now preventing, only his wife and children came with the
portion of the congregation that crossed the water. His
place in the colony was supplied by Mr. William Brewster,
a ruling elder in the church, and a man every way qualified
as a spiritual guide of the people.</p>

<p>The foundation of the colony of <span class="smcap">Massachusetts</span> was laid
in the year 1628. It was styled the <i>Colony of Massachusetts
bay</i>, the territory of which had been purchased by the
Plymouth company&mdash;by Sir Henry Roswell, Sir John
Young, and several others. The patent included all that
part of New England lying between three miles to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
northward of Merrimack river, and three miles to the
southward of Charles river, extending in length from the
Atlantic ocean to the South sea. The leader of the expedition
was Mr. John Endicot, whose character may be summed
up by saying, that he was a fit person to found that noble
commonwealth. He came with one hundred emigrants, and
was appointed governor of the colony. Mr. White, an
eminent minister, was one of the company. Three years
previously, a small company of adventurers had emigrated
to a place in the Massachusetts bay, afterwards called Mount
Wollaston, after the name of their leader; but, having no
religious object in view, they fell into shameful irregularities.
Upon the arrival of Endicot, however, a check was put on
these proceedings, and their leader, Morton, was finally sent
to England. These pious non-conformists under Endicot,
like the Plymouth colonists, sought a refuge from oppression
in their religious concerns, and desired to build up a community
on the true principles of Christianity. They located
themselves at Numkeag, (Salem,) where the first permanent
town in Massachusetts was constituted. In the following
year, they were joined by about two hundred others from
England, making in the whole three hundred; of which
number one hundred removed the same year, and settled
themselves, with the consent of Governor Endicot, at Mishawam,
now Charlestown. At this period, on the petition of
the Massachusetts company, King Charles by charter confirmed
the patent of the Massachusetts colony. By this
instrument, they were empowered to elect a governor,
deputy governor, and eighteen assistants, out of the freemen
of said company, by the greater part of the company. The
first governor, under this renewed charter, was Matthew
Cradock. The company being desirous of establishing their
plantation in the order of the Gospel, engaged two eminent
divines, Mr. Higginson and Mr. Skelton, to go out for the
spiritual service of the colony. Soon after their arrival at
Salem, they were placed over the church there with all due
solemnity, the one as teacher, the other as pastor. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
excellent men, however, lived but a short period, sharing
largely, as they did, in the sickness and suffering that diminished
the strength and shortened the lives of a large number
of their people.</p>

   <p class="caption2">Boston founded.</p>
</div>

<p>Among the many persons of distinction who left England
the ensuing year, on account of the stringent measures of
the government in regard to affairs both of church and state,
are found the names of Isaac Johnson, John Winthrop,
Thomas Dudley, and Sir Richard Saltonstall. These gentlemen,
by their persuasions, were the means of having the
charter and government of the company transferred to New
England. They left with fifteen hundred other persons, in
a fleet of seventeen sail, Winthrop having been chosen
governor under the new order of things. They arrived in
safety, eleven ships at one time, and six at another; and
before the conclusion of the season, commenced settlements
in several places; which, at present, constitute some of the
fairest towns of New England. Governor Winthrop, and
a portion of the company, laid the foundation of Boston.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
Several most highly esteemed ministers accompanied the
expedition just spoken of; Mr. Wilson, Mr. Warham, and
others. These were placed over the several churches that
soon began to be formed in this vicinity. The first general
court of Massachusetts, was held in Boston this year, on the
19th of October, at which time many of the planters attended,
and were made freemen of the colony. The winters of 1630
and 1631, were very fatal to the Massachusetts colony. Frost
and sickness carried off a number, and famine at length
threatened the suffering survivors. They were, however,
providentially relieved by the arrival of a ship from England
with provisions, the day previously to a public fast, which
had been appointed on account of the alarming state of
things. This circumstance turned the intended fast into a
general thanksgiving. The colony continued to increase
by fresh accessions of emigrants till the year 1640, up to
which time, it is computed that four thousand families had
arrived in New England. From this small beginning have
arisen the population, power, wealth, piety, and freedom of
the New England states.</p>

<p>In the year 1633, the Plymouth colony suffered from a
pestilential disease, which not only thinned their number,
but, extending to the neighboring territory, swept off many
of the Indians. In the same year, arrived those lights of
the New England church, Mr. John Cotton, Mr. Thomas
Hooker, and Mr. Samuel Stone, and that model of a magistrate,
Mr. William Collier, whose services, to the Plymouth
colony, were so considerable. Generally, the emigrants of
this period were actuated by the same spirit of opposition
to tyranny in church and state, and of love to the institutions
of Christianity, which had characterized their predecessors.
The men placed at the head of the new colonies
were, universally, men of sterling worth of character.</p>

<p>The first settlers of <span class="smcap">Connecticut</span> came from the eastern
shore of Massachusetts. They were a portion of the emigrants
who constituted the colonies of Plymouth and Massachusetts
bay. The emigration from England continuing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
to be large, and likely to increase from year to year, more
room was wanted, and especially locations where the soil
was rich and could be easily cultivated, became an object of
desire. This consideration, and, probably, others pertaining
to their tranquillity and increase as churches, had influence
on the resolution to seat themselves again in the wilderness.
It had happened, as early as the year 1631, that their attention
was directed to the beautiful and rich tract of land, on
the Connecticut river, by Wahcuimacut, a sachem living
upon the river. He made a journey to Plymouth and Boston,
with a view to enlist the governors of those colonies in
the project of making settlements in his country. The
proposition was not formally accepted, but the governor of
Plymouth was sufficiently interested in it to make a voyage
to the coast, in which excursion he discovered the river and
the adjacent territory; thus precluding the title of the Dutch
to any part of it, as they had neither "trading-house, nor
any pretence to a foot of land there."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The subject of
settling Connecticut was not lost sight of during one or two
subsequent years; but, occasionally, vessels were sent from
Plymouth to the river, for the purposes of trade, and, in one
instance, several men, from Dorchester, traveled through
the wilderness thither for the same object, as also to view
the country.</p>

<p>In 1633, when the Plymouth colony had determined to
commence the work of settlement, they commissioned William
Holmes, and a chosen company with him, to proceed
to Connecticut. They took with them the frame of a house,
which they set up in Windsor. They achieved their object,
notwithstanding the threatened opposition of the Dutch at
Hartford, where the latter, after learning that the Plymouth
people intended to settle on the river, had erected a slight
fort. The Plymouth people, also, were successful in defending
their trading-house subsequently, both against the Dutch
and the Indians. The Dutch erected a trading-house at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
Hartford the same year, the house at Windsor having preceded
it, perhaps, by a few months. The actual settlement
of the region, however, was deferred for a time, from the
fact of divided opinions on the subject in the Massachusetts
court. No vote could be obtained in favor of the project.
In the mean time, individuals were determined to prosecute
the enterprise, and a number of the people of Watertown
came, in 1634, to Connecticut. They erected a few huts at
Pyquag (Wethersfield), in which they contrived to pass the
winter. In the spring of 1635, the general court of Massachusetts
bay assented to the plan of emigration to Connecticut,
and, accordingly, preparations were made in several
places. The Watertown people gradually removed, and
added to their settlement at Wethersfield. Mr. Warham,
one of the ministers of Dorchester, accompanied by a great
part of the church, settled at Mattaneang (Windsor). A
company from Newtown began a plantation, between those
two settlements, at Suchiang (Hartford). In the course of
the year, a large body of settlers, sixty in number, came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
together&mdash;men, women, and children, with their horses, cattle,
and swine. It being somewhat late in the season, and
their journey proving to be long and difficult, winter came
upon them before they were prepared. They were but
indifferently sheltered, and their food was scanty&mdash;a large
portion of their furniture and provisions, having been put
on board of several small vessels, never reached them.
The vessels were lost, and some lives with them. A part
of their domestic animals they were obliged to leave on the
other side of the river. Famine and its fearful effects
were now to be encountered. It was impossible for all to
stay where they were. Some, attempted to return to the
east through the wilderness; others, went down to the
mouth of the river, in order to meet their provisions, and,
being disappointed, were obliged, finally, to embark on board
of a vessel for Boston. In both instances they suffered
greatly, but were providentially preserved to arrive at their
former home. The portion of the settlers who remained
were subjected to much distress. The resources of hunting
and food from the Indians being exhausted, they had
recourse to acorns, malt, and grains for subsistence. Large
numbers of their cattle perished. Their condition was
indeed most trying and perilous, in their solitude and separation
from others, at the mercy alike of the elements of
nature, and the power of savage foes. But their God, in
whom they trusted, carried them through in safety.</p>

<p>The Connecticut planters held courts of their own,
though they were settled under the general government of
the Massachusetts. These courts consisted of two principal
men from each town, joined sometimes by committees of
three additional persons, as occasion might require. The
first court was held at Hartford, April 26th, 1636. At this
season of the year, both those who had left Connecticut in
the winter and many others proceeded to take up their
residence on the river. At length, about the beginning of
June, a company of an hundred men, women, and children,
under Messrs. Hooker and Stone, took their departure from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
Cambridge, and traveled to Hartford through the pathless
wilderness that lay between the two places. Over mountains,
through ravines, swamps, thickets, and rivers, they
made their way, submitting to incredible fatigue and many
privations. These trials, to a portion of the new comers,
must have been peculiarly severe, as they were a class of
society who, having enjoyed all the comforts and elegancies
of life, knew little of hardship and danger.</p>

<p>The year preceding, a fort was erected at the mouth of
the river, called Saybrook fort, in honor of Lords Say and
Brooks, to whom, with several others, a commission had
been given to begin a plantation at Connecticut. This was
effected under the auspices of John Winthrop, a son of the
governor of Massachusetts. Winthrop's commission interfered
with the settlement commenced by the Massachusetts
colonists, but the latter were left in the quiet enjoyment of
their possessions. The number of persons in the three
towns of Hartford, Windsor, and Wethersfield, was about
eight hundred at the close of the year 1636.</p>

<p>The succeeding year was signalized for the critical
condition of the settlement. There was a great want of
provisions and of the implements of husbandry, and every
article bore a high price. The year was also filled with
the incidents of warfare. In the feebleness of its infancy,
the little colony was called to contend with one of the most
warlike tribes of Indians that ever inhabited New England.
And never were heroism and fortitude displayed in a more
marked degree, or animated by a loftier spirit of patriotism
and piety. The particulars need not be here rehearsed.
Suffice it to say, they completely triumphed over their
savage foe, the Pequots, under their brave leader, Captain
John Mason. They went forth to battle, under the sanction
and rites of religion, to save themselves, their wives, and
children, and the Church of Christ in the wilderness, from
utter extinction. The holy ardor of Hooker, in his incomparable
address to the soldiers, filled their minds with an
unwavering confidence in God. Seventy-seven brave men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
saved Connecticut, and destroyed the most terrible Indian
nation in New England.</p>

   <p class="caption2">Hooker addressing the Soldiers.</p>
</div>

<p>This necessity of warfare they would gladly have
avoided, for the condition of the settlement required all
their energies and efforts at home. They could neither
hunt, fish, nor cultivate their fields, nor travel the shortest
distance, while an insidious and cruel foe was hovering
around them. They felt that he must be crippled or
destroyed, or that their entire settlement would be cut off
by piecemeal. The natives embraced every opportunity
of committing depredations on the lives and property of
the whites. A picture of the kind of life which was passed
in those times of savage treachery and English daring, is
given in the following detail of incidents, which occurred
on the water immediately previous to the Pequot war:</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

   <img src="images/illus-083.jpg" alt="Gallop finds Oldham murdered." title="Gallop finds Oldham murdered." />
   <p class="caption2">Gallop finds Oldham murdered.</p>
</div>

<p>"John Oldham, who had been fairly trading at Connecticut,
was murdered near Block island. He had with him
only two boys and two Narraganset Indians. These were
taken and carried off. One John Gallop, as he was going
from Connecticut to Boston, discovered Mr. Oldham's vessel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
full of Indians, and he saw a canoe full of Indians on board,
go from her laden with goods. Suspecting that they had
murdered Mr. Oldham, he hailed them, but received no
answer. Gallop was a bold man, and though he had with
him but one man and two boys, he immediately bore down
upon them, and fired duck-shot so thick among them, that
he soon cleared the deck. The Indians all got under the
hatches. He then stood off; and, running down upon her
quarter with a brisk gale, nearly overset them, and so
frighted the Indians, that six of them leaped into the sea,
and were drowned. He then steered off again; and, running
down upon her a second time, bored her with his
anchor, and raked her fore and aft with his shot. But the
Indians kept themselves so close, he got loose from her;
and, running down a third time upon the vessel, he gave
her such a shock, that five more leaped overboard, and
perished, as the former had done. He then boarded the
vessel, and took two of the Indians, and bound them. Two
or three others, armed with swords, in a little room below,
could not be driven from their retreat. Mr. Oldham's corse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
was found on board, the head split and the body mangled
in a barbarous manner. He was a Dorchester man, one
of Mr. Warham's congregation. In these circumstances,
Gallop, fearing that the Indians whom he had taken might
get loose, especially if they were kept together, and having
no place where he could keep them apart, threw one of
them overboard. Gallop and his company then, as decently
as circumstances would permit, put the corse into the sea.
They stripped the vessel, and took the rigging and the
goods which had not been carried off on board their own.
She was taken in tow, with a view to carry her in; but the
night coming on and the wind rising, Gallop was obliged to
let her go adrift, and she was lost."</p>

<p>At the termination of the Pequot war, there was a great
scarcity of provisions in Connecticut, and fearful apprehensions
were felt on the part of the settlers. With all their
efforts, they had not been able to raise a sufficiency of provisions,
and these became at length very costly. Corn rose
to the extraordinary price of twelve shillings by the bushel.
The debt contracted by the war was paid with difficulty.
Nothing saved the colony from a famine but a providential
supply of corn, which they were enabled to purchase from
the natives, at an Indian settlement called Pocomptock
(Deerfield).</p>

<p>The first constitution of Connecticut was adopted January
15, 1639, by the free planters of the three towns of
Windsor, Hartford, and Wethersfield, who convened at
Hartford for the purpose. It was an admirably contrived
instrument, providing for the freedom and liberties of themselves
and their posterity. Some fifty years ago, Doctor
Trumbull remarked, respecting it, that it was "one of the
most free and happy institutions of civil government which
has ever been formed. The formation of it at so early a
period, when the light of liberty was wholly darkened in
most parts of the earth, and the rights of men so little
understood in others, does great honor to their ability,
integrity, and love to mankind. To posterity, indeed, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
exhibited a most benevolent regard. It has continued with
little alteration to the present time."</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">New Haven</span> colony was settled in the spirit that
influenced the comers to the other parts of New England,
and eminently so. The establishment of the Church of God
on its true basis, and the enjoyment of civil and religious
liberty, was the object of the emigrants; and they proceeded
to secure the fair inheritance by the wisest counsels and
the most efficient action. The company who first constituted
the settlement, was a rare assemblage of choice spirits.
Among them were John Davenport, a distinguished minister
in London, and Theophilus Eaton and Edward Hopkins,
wealthy merchants of the same city, and eminent for their
abilities and integrity. They with their associates arrived
at Boston in the summer of 1637, and would have been
gladly retained in the Massachusetts colony, had they consented.
Strong inducements were held out to them to fix
their residence there, but they wanted more room than they
could find in the vicinity of Boston for themselves and the
large number of friends whom they expected to follow them.
Their principal reason, however, for migrating elsewhere,
as suggested by the historian of Connecticut, was probably
"the desire of being at the head of a new government, modeled,
both in civil and religious matters, agreeably to their
own apprehensions. It had been an observation of Mr.
Davenport, that whenever a reformation had been effected
in the church, in any part of the world, it had rested where
it had been left by the reformers: it could not be advanced
another step. He was embarked in a design of forming a
civil and religious constitution, as near as possible to scripture
precept and example." Their strict views, it seems,
could not be fully met elsewhere.</p>

<p>Mr. Davenport and his company, on the 30th of March,
1638, sailed from Boston to Quinnipiac (New Haven), and
arrived at the desired spot at about the middle of April. A
portion of their company, with Eaton at their head, had
made a journey to Connecticut during the preceding autumn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
to explore the lands and harbors on the sea-coast; and
having fixed upon Quinnipiac as the best place for a settlement,
erected a hut there, in which a few men passed the
winter. The first Sabbath which Mr. Davenport spent in
the wilderness, was on the 18th of April, 1638, when he
preached a discourse on the <i>Temptations of the Wilderness</i>.
In a short time, at the close of a day of fasting and prayer,
they entered into what they called a plantation covenant,
in which they solemnly engaged, in their civil ordinances
as well as religion, they would be governed by the rules
of scripture. At different times, and in separate contracts,
they purchased their lands of the Indians, by the payment
of such articles as were satisfactory to the latter. As the
New Haven adventurers were the most opulent company
which came into New England, they were disposed and
able to lay the foundation of a first-rate colony&mdash;the proofs
of which are visible, in part, in the elegant city which
became its capital. The foundations of the civil and religious
polity of the colony were laid on the 4th of June,
1639, with every due solemnity. The act was not consummated
until the 25th of October of the same year, as a
term of trial was required for the seven men who were to
constitute the seven pillars of the church. The number of
subscribers to the compact, on the 4th of June, was sixty-three;
to which there were soon after added about fifty
other names. This colony enjoyed great comparative order
and tranquillity, as well from the extreme care with which
it was constituted at the beginning, the superior wealth and
character of its founders, and their wise and prudent intercourse
with their neighbors, the Indians.</p>

<p>The New Haven colony was distinguished among the
sister-colonies for its zeal in behalf of education, for its great
strictness in the administration of the laws, for its scrupulous
justice towards the Indians, and for the absence of a
frivolous or extravagant legislation, which in some instances
had been thought to characterize the other colonies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
The colony, however, was not exempt from occasional
providential calamities, particularly in its commercial pursuits.
For a period, the colonists did not succeed in
their principal secular object. Their plans may not have
been the most judicious; but their greatest misfortune in
this concern was the loss of a large ship, which contained
a valuable cargo of about five thousand pounds. The ship,
with its precious burden, and more precious navigators,
was never heard of more after it left the harbor. Several
other settlements in the vicinity were nearly coëval with
that of New Haven. Milford and Guilford were settled in
1639, as also Stratford and Fairfield the same year; Stamford
in 1641, and soon after the town of Brandford.</p>

</div>

<p>A settlement, at an early period, was made in <span class="smcap">New Hampshire</span>,
but it did not, until some time afterwards, constitute a
distinct colony. In the spring of the year 1623, two members
of the council of Plymouth (Gorges and Mason) having
obtained a grant of a tract of country, sent over a few
persons for the purpose of establishing a colony and fishing
at the river Piscataqua. This was the beginning of the
town of Portsmouth; but, for several years, together with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
the town of Dover, which had a fish-house erected about
the same time, it was a small and scarcely permanent settlement.
In 1629, some of the settlers about the Massachusetts
bay, purchased a tract of country of the Indians, with
a view to unite with the settlement at Piscataqua. After
this purchase, the latter settlement was favored with a
small increase; but no other settlements were made till the
year 1638, when the towns of Exeter and Hampton commenced.
Exeter was settled by people chiefly from Boston,
who had been regularly dismissed from their church relations,
and were constituted at once into a church in their
new locality. Like the settlers of the other New England
colonies, those of New Hampshire were desirous of enjoying
the ministrations and ordinances of the Gospel, and were
able to obtain excellent ministers.</p>

<p>These several plantations continued, for many years, to
live on good terms with the natives, and were generally
well supplied with provisions, in consequence of their
advantages for fishery. They constituted distinct civil
communities, after the most perfect model of freedom, but
were unable to preserve their peculiar organization, on
account of the intrusion of disaffected individuals, from the
colonies of Massachusetts and Plymouth, and the constant
influx of other emigrants. They were too weak thus to
stand alone, and, after suitable negociations on the subject,
they came under the jurisdiction of Massachusetts, in 1641,
on the condition of enjoying equal privileges with the people
of that colony, and having a court of justice maintained
among themselves. This union continued nearly forty
years, and was followed by the greater increase and
security of the colony.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>The rise of the colony of <span class="smcap">Rhode Island</span> commenced in
the expulsion of Roger Williams from Massachusetts. He
was a minister of the Gospel at Salem; but, holding tenets
that were obnoxious to the people there, and being unwilling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
to renounce them, after friendly remonstrance and
dealing, he was ordered to quit the jurisdiction of Massachusetts.
He accordingly took his exile thence, and traveling,
with his few followers, as far as the present town of
Rehoboth, he sat down there; but, being within the jurisdiction
of Plymouth, Governor Winslow, out of courtesy
to the government of Massachusetts, desired Mr. Williams
to leave that place. The latter, then crossing the Pawtucket
river, came to the spot which, in acknowledgment
of God's merciful providence to him in his distress, he called
'Providence.' He purchased the lands of his plantation
of the Indian owners, became the father of the colony, and,
for a period, appeared to have combined, in his person,
the principal powers of government. Times of scarcity
occurred in the Providence plantation, as in most of the
other colonies in North America, and the followers of Mr.
Williams were saved from famine only by the products of
their forests and rivers. No personal resentment seems to
have arisen between Mr. Williams and Governor Winthrop,
from the proceedings which led to the founding of the new
settlement. All the several colonies remained at peace, and
cultivated friendship with each other.</p>

<p>The religious difficulties in Massachusetts, arising out of
the case of the fanatical Mrs. Hutchinson, were the occasion
of the origin of the Rhode Island plantation, south of
Providence. Several gentlemen differed in principle from
the prevailing belief of the churches, and chose to leave the
colony. Among them were William Coddington, John
Clark, and others, who came to Providence in search of a
place where they might enjoy their own sentiments unmolested.
Through the assistance of Mr. Williams, they
purchased Aquetnec of the Indian sachems. The adventurers,
eighteen in number, incorporated themselves into a
body politic, and chose Mr. Coddington to be their judge,
or chief magistrate. The character of the climate and soil,
soon brought many adventurers to their settlement. The
territory was <span class="smcap">Rhode Island</span>, according to its subsequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
name. The two settlements of Mr. Williams and Mr.
Coddington, being destitute of any charter from the mother-country,
the former went to England with a view to procure
one. He succeeded in the object, and returned with a
liberal charter of incorporation of Providence and Rhode
Island plantations.</p>

<p>The district, now state, of <span class="smcap">Maine</span>, though the first permanent
settlement commenced in 1630, was for a long time
in an unhappy condition, from the number and hostility of
the Indians within its borders. The early settlers, after the
death of their proprietary, Sir Fernando Gorges, formed
some kind of voluntary compacts, and chose their own
rulers; but the difficulties under which they labored induced
them, in 1650, to unite with the government of Massachusetts,
and to become an integral part of that colony. Their
civil and religious institutions generally resembled those of
the other colonies of New England. In the first settlements,
churches were early established, which enjoyed the
labors of some of the worthiest ministers of their time.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>A project of great importance was consummated, in
1643, in the <i>union</i> formed by the New England colonists.
It had been proposed, by the colonies of Connecticut and
New Haven, as early as 1638, but was not brought to a
conclusion until five years after. The confederacy consisted
of Massachusetts, New Plymouth, Connecticut, and
New Haven. The plan of it evidently reminds one of the
great confederacy, afterwards formed between the thirteen
United States, with similar provisions and principles. It
was a powerful means of defence, and of the subsequent
strength and prosperity of the colonies. It maintained their
internal peace, awed the savage tribes, and caused their
neighbors, the Dutch, and the French in Canada, to respect
them. By the articles of confederation, they entered into a
firm and perpetual league of friendship and amity, for
offence and defence, mutual advice and assistance upon all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
just occasions, both for preserving and propagating the
truth and liberties of the Gospel, and for their own mutual
safety and welfare. Each colony was to continue its
separate organization, as to courts and laws, but to be considered
as one, in regard to their public transactions. This
union subsisted, with some alterations, more than forty
years, and was dissolved when the charters of all the colonies
were rescinded by James II. It was known under the
style of <i>The United Colonies of New England</i>.</p>

<p>The state of <span class="smcap">Vermont</span> was not settled until long after the
other New England states. It was as late as the year
1724, before any settlement was made in that territory.
This was on a spot, within the present town of Brattleborough,
where, at the same time, during a severe Indian war,
the government of Massachusetts had erected a fort. It
was then supposed that the settlement was within the limits
of that state, but it afterwards appeared not to be the case.
Subsequently it was believed that the territory belonged to
New Hampshire. Grants were accordingly made from
time to time, by the latter colony, of tracts within the territory
of Vermont. As it was the scene of warfare, during
the middle part of the century, the country became well
known to many individuals, and not a few openings were
made in the wilderness, towards the cessation of hostilities,
on the northern borders. During the revolutionary war,
the Green-mountain Boys, as they were familiarly called,
distinguished themselves by their bravery, and rendered
important service to the cause. In 1777, the inhabitants
constituted themselves an independent state. As Vermont
was settled mostly by emigrants from Connecticut, the
character of the people was similar to that of the inhabitants
of the latter state, and of New England in general.
They were careful to establish their civil and religious
institutions in accordance with those of the sister-states,
and have been highly distinguished by their stability in the
principles and usages of the fathers.</p>

<p>The <i>character</i> of the early settlers of New England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
deserves a distinct notice, beyond that which has incidentally
appeared in narrating the history of their achievements.
A brief sketch can only be presented, and scarcely commensurate
with the importance of the topic; but it is all
that the limits of this work will admit. The greatness of
the results, though affected extensively by the direct providence
of God, manifests the peculiarity of the dispositions
and motives of the agents who were concerned in producing
them.</p>

<p>The planters of New England were men of whom their
descendants need not be ashamed. So far as the pride of
ancestry may be lawfully indulged, New Englanders, of
the present race, may indulge it to the full, in view of the
character and deeds of their forefathers. They were <i>inferior</i>
men in <i>no sense of the word</i>, however apt we may be
to connect the idea of adventurers with that of a roving,
restless, dissipated, loose-living class of men, loving savage
nature, or freedom from the restraints of civilized life.
They became adventurers, not from love of adventure, but
from high and noble impulses&mdash;the impulses of religion.
To advance that precious interest was, indeed, their commanding
object. This was indicated by their circumstances
and manner of life in Holland before they removed thence,
and by the desire they felt to leave that country. Could
their favorite views, in respect to religion, have been carried
out there, they would, probably, never have come to
this western wilderness. Their declarations and professions,
through their leading men, also show that the establishment
and enjoyment of a free Gospel was their great object.
Their laws and institutions, moreover, evince that this was
their principal concern, in connection with the diffusion of
education and knowledge. These all had reference, more
or less directly, to the moral and religious welfare of the
community. The cause of God and righteousness was
guarded by the wisest and most decided legal provisions.
The concurrent declarations of all the early writers among
them, likewise indicate the spirit and purposes which distinguished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
the fathers of New England above, perhaps, all
other settlers of new countries, in proposing and carrying
forward the interests of religion. Indeed, no object but
religion and its enjoyment, could have borne them through
their almost unprecedented trials and privations. To these
they voluntarily submitted, on account of their religion.
They were not otherwise compelled to leave their native
land and the homes of their childhood&mdash;the seats of ease
and plenty. To hardships, of any kind, many of them had
never been exposed before; but the love of God's word,
and freedom of worship, according to the light of their own
minds, were motives, with them, sufficient to brave every
peril and earthly woe.</p>

<p>They were not inferior men, in respect to their <i>civil
standing in the community</i>. They did not proceed, generally,
from the lower orders of society&mdash;the poorer artisans
and the laborers. They belonged, mostly, to the middle
and respectable ranks of English society. A few were
classed with the higher orders, but not to the same extent
as was the fact with the settlers of Virginia, if we may
judge from the list of names and titles of several emigrants
of the different colonies. In respect to a worldly, chivalrous
bearing and spirit of adventure, New England and
Virginia differed&mdash;the latter were eminent in this respect,
but never were men more truly brave than the fathers of
New England; in moral courage, they were unrivalled.
Like other adventurers, they manifested their undaunted
spirit in relinquishing their comfortable homes, in braving
the dangers of the deep, in encountering the horrors of a
wilderness, in incurring the risk of famine and pestilence,
and in frequently combatting a fierce savage foe. There
were as extraordinary traits of martial heroism displayed
among the pilgrims of New England, when called forth by
the necessity of circumstances, as can be found in the history
of any of the American colonists, though this was not
a characteristic in which they gloried. The exploits of
Miles Standish, of Plymouth, and John Mason, of Connecticut,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
might be ranked among the most striking exhibitions
of courage on record. Of Standish, it is remarked, by an
old historian, that "he was allied to the noble house of
Standish, in Lancashire, and inherited some of the virtues
of that honorable family, as well as the name." But the
high bearing and courage of the planters was eminently of
a moral kind. Unlike their Virginian neighbors, they suffered
no misrule in their settlements. If any threatened
for a time, they promptly put it down. Their courage was
seen in resisting evil among themselves. They feared not
to put their laws into execution. They were characterized
by a healthful, vigorous public spirit, consenting to
sacrifice their own individual interest for the general good.
They thus manifested a noble nature, the product of principle,
if not of birth.</p>

<p>The fathers of New England were not <i>ignorant</i> men,
and unversed in the concerns of the world. Their clergymen
and leading men in civil life, were among the ripe
scholars of the age. They had been educated at the
English universities, and numbers of them had occupied
important stations in church and state. As authors and
men of influence, in their native land, they could not have
sunk their high character by emigration; and though in
a wilderness, and under the pressure of mighty cares, they
could not so advantageously pursue their studies as in the
shades of academic retirement, they still did not neglect
to add to their intellectual stores. In several instances,
they brought large and valuable libraries with them. The
writings of Colton, Hooker, Davenport, Winthrop, Bradford,
Prince, and others, show that they were eminently men of
mind and masters of language&mdash;that they were well versed
in the science and literature which adorned the age; and
their universal learning, sanctified by grace, we know, was
devoted to the most noble and beneficent purposes. There
were among the merchants and men of business, who had
figured in the world's affairs before they came to these solitudes&mdash;men
of large experience and cultivated taste, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
wanting in any accomplishment deemed essential in refined
and honorable society. The mass of the people, who came
over to this country as its settlers, must evidently, from the
nature of the case, have been of that thinking, intellectual,
practical class, who understood their rights and duties as
human beings, as also the principles of government; and
could not, therefore, with their good sense and honesty,
submit to the exactions and wrongs of tyranny. This, of
all others, is the most valuable body of the community.</p>

<p>The estimate which the fathers placed upon education,
is seen in the immediate establishment of literary institutions,
both of the higher and lower grades. Scarcely had
the venerable men felled the trees of the forest, than they
erected the common school-house, the academy, and the
college. In the midst of their untold personal pressing
cares and troubles, they exercised a far-reaching sagacity
and benevolent regard towards the common good, and
towards posterity, in laying broadly the foundations of
order, intelligence, and virtue. They conceived the highest
idea of the importance of sound education to their rising
republic. They wisely judged that solid learning and true
religion were the firmest pillars of the commonwealth and
of the church. Within ten years from the settlement of
Massachusetts, a college, with good endowments, was
founded for the use of the colony.</p>

<p>The planters of New England were not <i>poor</i> men&mdash;needy
adventurers. Had they been such, whence could the funds
have been derived that were necessary to sustain the
enterprise? It is evident that large sums of money were
expended in the transportation of themselves, their cattle,
and their effects to this country, and in their various removals
when here, as well as in the continued sustentation of
their families in times of scarcity and famine. These we
know, from their history, were of frequent occurrence.
Governors Winthrop, Haynes, Eaton, and Hopkins, were
men of wealth; so also were Mr. Johnson, Mr. Colton, and
Mr. Hooker&mdash;the last two uncommonly rich for ministers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
Mr. Johnson was reputed to be the wealthiest of all the
original emigrants. The mass of the early comers must
also have possessed no inconsiderable means, to enable
them to bear the heavy expenses of their voyage and settlement.
With such a basis of property, it is not a matter
of surprise that, notwithstanding the drain and exhaustion
of the few first years, they should have increased greatly
in their worldly substance in the end, inasmuch as they
settled on a virgin soil, possessed abundance of land, and
carried on a lucrative trade in the products of the country.
Their habits of sobriety and industry were essentially
favorable to their advancement in wealth.</p>

<p>The New England planters were not <i>wanting in any
moral virtues</i>, <i>piety</i>, <i>wisdom</i>, <i>or magnanimity</i>. There
never lived on earth, if we may credit history, a more disinterested,
upright, conscientious, prudent, and holy body
of men. Their souls were imbued with the loftiest principles
of patriotism and piety. They gave undoubted proofs
of the possession of this spirit in their exertions, toils, and
sacrifices for the best welfare of their descendants and the
cause of Christianity&mdash;in their spirituality, prayerfulness,
purity, and well-ordered lives. They wished, above all
things, to serve God and to do good&mdash;to transmit to posterity
a pure church and free form of government. They
received the Word of God as their sole guide in religious
concerns and moral conduct&mdash;they regulated their individual
life, their families, their local societies, their churches,
and their state, by its rules, so far as the latter could be
consistently applied. They were sound in the faith, receiving
the doctrines of grace as the real system of divine
truth&mdash;were strict in preserving the order and carrying
out the discipline of the churches&mdash;and were rigid in the
administration of law and justice. Their zeal and liberality
in supporting the institutions of the Gospel among
themselves, and in efforts to Christianize the Indians, were
marked traits in their character. They considered it one
of the great objects of their mission to this continent, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
become the means of the salvation of its aboriginal inhabitants,
and thus to extend Christ's kingdom in the world. In
a most commendable degree, they carried their religion
into the various every-day concerns of life, and consulted,
especially on every occasion of interest and importance,
the particular guidance and blessing of God.</p>

<p>Such was the character of New England's fathers: they
were not perfect men; they did not claim for themselves
the attributes of perfection; neither can others, their warmest
panegyrists, claim it for them with any consistency.
They had their errors&mdash;the errors of the age. All darkness
had not passed away from their understandings, nor
all obliquity from their hearts. There was an austerity, a
preciseness in some points, an unaccommodating temper,
which perhaps is not well suited to all times, or every state
of society, but which better agreed with their circumstances
as the founders of a nation, and as an example for others
to follow. In the natural course of imitation from age to
age, there will be apt to be a feebler resemblance of the
original; so that where the conduct in the beginning was
over-strict, in the lapse of years it will be apt to fall quite
too far below the true standard of virtue. The founders
of a nation, if they fail at all in firmness of temper or rigidness
of discipline, will be very apt to bring on the sooner a
dissolute state of the body politic. Our fathers, on this
account, were not so much at fault as many suppose. They
were fitted, by the guidance and grace of God, for the
times in which they lived&mdash;for the work which they were
called to perform. If some few spots or shades could have
been effaced from their characters, they would have been
still more fitting instruments of good to the Church and to
posterity; but as the case is, no other founders of an empire
probably ever possessed so large a portion of wisdom and
goodness.</p>

<p>In respect to charges made against the fathers of New
England, pertaining to superstition, enthusiasm, injustice
towards the Indians, treatment of supposed witches, bigotry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
persecution, and the incorporation of church and state, they
are capable of a satisfactory refutation in all the material
points, and have often received that refutation. While
something, however, is to be laid to human imperfection in
their case, yet, even in these matters, more is due to the
grace of God, which preserved them so comparatively free
from evils to which their natural dispositions, or their circumstances,
might be supposed to lead them.</p>

<p>It was indeed a new order of things which was introduced
by the pilgrim fathers, in their removal to America.
The Mayflower came to these shores freighted with great
moral principles, as well as with a precious cargo of godly
men and women. Of those principles, some were the following,
viz: The right of private judgment in the examination
of divine truth, is to be held sacred&mdash;Conscience,
enlightened by the Word of God, is a sufficient guide as to
truth and duty&mdash;a majority governs in church and state&mdash;universal
education is the basis of free government&mdash;the
observation of the Sabbath is a moral virtue, and essential
to the safety of a people. From these principles, others
have been deduced; or to them others, of scarcely less
importance, have been added in more recent times.</p>

<p>The settlement of the state of <span class="smcap">New York</span> commenced
in 1613, so far as the erection of a fort, near the present
city of Albany, and a few trading-houses on the island of
Manhattan (New York), may be said to constitute a settlement.
The Dutch founded their claim to the soil from the
discovery of the Hudson by an Englishman of that name,
who was then in the employ of the Dutch; but the British
king disputed the claim, from the fact of the previous discovery
of the country by the Cabots. The Dutch were
forced, for a short time, to yield to the demands of the
English; but, the colony having increased in the course of
a year, the English were required, in their turn, to yield
their authority to the original occupants. For a series of
years, the latter continued in peaceful possession, and, by
characteristic toil and perseverance, secured the blessings
of a growing settlement.</p>

<p>The territory on both sides of the Hudson, occupied by the
settlers, was called New Netherlands. In defence of their
colony, in 1623, they built several forts, one on the east side
of Delaware bay, which they named Nassau, and another,
one hundred and fifty miles up the river, which they called
Aurania. At the mouth of the river they built a town, to
which they gave the name of New Amsterdam, afterwards
New York. Near fort Nassau, the Swedes had a settlement,
and, from the interfering claims of the two people,
quarrels arose, which in a few years ended in the subjugation
of the Swedes. In consequence of the Dutch claims
so far to the eastward, difficulties frequently arose between
them and the Connecticut and New Haven colonies; but
these never amounted to another rupture, and the Dutch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
were occasionally assisted in the Indian warfare by their
more courageous neighbors.</p>

<p>At the ascension of Charles II. to the British throne, the
province of New Netherlands passed into the hands of the
English. As the king, by a charter, had conveyed the
whole territory to his brother, the Duke of York and
Albany, he undertook to effect his object by force, and
accordingly despatched an armament, under the command
of Colonel Nichols, who was also appointed governor of
the province. The exhibition of force was the means of
effecting a treaty of capitulation on the part of Stuyvesant
the Dutch governor. From this time, New Amsterdam
and the whole conquered province received the name of
New York, the original settlers choosing, for the most part,
to remain, and being permitted to adopt many of their own
forms of government.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">New Jersey</span> was settled by the Dutch, not long after
they had fixed themselves on the Hudson river. The
Danes, also, commenced a settlement at a place to which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
they gave the name Bergen. This was about the year
1624. In 1626, a company of Swedes and Finns purchased
land on both sides of Delaware river, and commenced a
settlement on the western bank. The Dutch, however,
considering themselves as the original settlers, laid claim to
the country. They had built a fort, as early as 1623, on
the east bank of the South river, as the Delaware was then
called. It was not until the year 1640, that the English
made any attempt to colonize the territory in question, and
then they were resisted and expelled by the Swedes and
Dutch. A few years afterwards, however, the Duke of
York granted New Jersey to John, Lord Berkley, and Sir
George Carteret, the territory receiving that name in compliment
to Sir George, who had been governor of the island
of Jersey in the English channel. Carteret soon after arrived
at Elizabethtown, which he made the seat of government.</p>

<p>The state of <span class="smcap">Delaware</span> was originally settled by the
Dutch and Swedes, the former as early as 1629, having
purchased a tract of land near Cape Henlopen. The enterprise
of planting a colony, on the Delaware, was entrusted
to an experienced navigator, De Vriez; and, in 1630, an
association was formed for this purpose, in pursuance of
which, a settlement was made, the next spring, on the west
side of the river, at a place since called Lewiston. The
Swedes, also, made considerable settlements on the same
side of the river; but, whether these preceded that of the
Dutch, is considered doubtful, the more recent authorities
leaning rather to the Dutch claim. The Swedes, however,
whatever their pretensions may have been, were conquered
by the Dutch, in whose possession the country remained
until the surrender of New York, in 1664. It was immediately
after taken possession of, for the Duke of York, by
Sir Robert Carr. A portion of its subsequent history is
included in that of Pennsylvania, as Delaware had not
even an assembly, separate from that of Pennsylvania, for
several years.</p>

<p>Settlements commenced in <span class="smcap">Maryland</span> as early as 1634.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
Two or three years previously, Lord Baltimore had visited
the colony of Virginia, and, observing that the Virginians
had formed no settlement to the northward of the river
Potomac, he determined to procure a grant of territory in
that region; but he died before the necessary authority by
charter, which Charles had promised, could be given him.
The patent, however, was filled up for his son, Cornelius
Calvert, who had then become Lord Baltimore. The king
gave to the new province the name of Maryland, in honor
of his queen, Henrietta Maria. It was originally included
in the patent of the south Virginia company, a circumstance
which gave rise, for a time, to disputes and difficulties
between these communities. Lord Baltimore pursued a
wise course in forming his colony. He established a basis
of security to property and of freedom to religion, bestowing,
in absolute fee, fifty acres of land on every emigrant,
and allowing toleration to the various sects of the Christian
faith. George Calvert, the brother of the governor, arrived
with the first colony, consisting of about two hundred
Roman Catholics, from England. Calvert, by kindness and
liberality, obtained possession of an Indian town of importance,
to which he gave the name of St. Mary's. Lord
Baltimore was constituted the proprietor of the province;
and he and his descendants, with some years of interruption,
continued to enjoy the rights of jurisdiction and property
until the time of the Revolution. Then the people, having
adopted a constitution, refused to admit the claims of the
representatives of Lord Baltimore.</p>

<p>The charter, embracing what is now <span class="smcap">North Carolina</span>,
<span class="smcap">South Carolina</span>, and <span class="smcap">Georgia</span>, was granted by Charles II.,
in 1662, to Edward, Earl of Clarendon; George, Duke of
Albemarle; William, Lord Craven, and several others.
This country was called Florida, and claimed by the Spaniards.
The claim, nevertheless, was supposed to be relinquished
by the stipulations of a treaty between Great
Britain and Spain, in 1667. The previous efforts to colonize
this portion of the American continent had been unsuccessful,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
and grants that had been given to different individuals
were now pronounced by the privy council to be null and
void. A government was organized over the few settlers
that were scattered in different parts, Mr. Drummond
having been appointed governor. The settlers on Albemarle
sound were allowed, on certain conditions, to retain
their lands. The proprietors of the Carolinas did not make
serious effort towards adding to the number of the colonists
until 1667. Two ships carried out a number of adventurers,
with provisions, arms, and utensils, necessary for building
and cultivation. Sayle was appointed governor in 1669.
In what place he first landed is uncertain; but not being
pleased with his situation, he moved to the southward, and
took possession of a neck of land between Ashley and
Cooper rivers. Here he laid out a town, which, in honor
of the British king, he called Charleston. This was the
origin of South Carolina, as distinguished from North Carolina.
The distance between Albemarle and the new
location, induced the proprietors to establish two separate
governments, the settlements on the sound constituting
North Carolina. The early existence of the northern
colony is said to have been marked, in a sad degree, by
confusion and misrule, owing mainly to the exceptionable
nature of its fundamental constitutions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Georgia</span>, though the last of the English colonies established
in North America, may be mentioned here, since it
was included in the original grant with the Carolinas. The
charter of Georgia, as a district, was granted in 1732, and
embraced the country on the south of the Carolinas, between
the rivers Savannah and Altamaha, and extended westward
from the heads of these rivers to the South sea. It was given
to twenty-one persons, who were wealthy and influential
individuals, as trustees, who were incorporated for the purpose
of settling and establishing the colony. In pursuance
of this design, in 1733, James Oglethorpe embarked for the
province, with one hundred and sixteen persons destined for
settlement. He selected the present site of Savannah, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
the most desirable spot for this object. Here he built a
fort, and put the colony in a proper state of defence, not
neglecting, in the mean time, to cultivate friendly relations
with the Indians. Though the objects of the settlement of
Georgia were in a great measure benevolent&mdash;as they contemplated,
among other things, an asylum for the poor and
wretched in England and Ireland&mdash;yet the hopes of prosperity,
entertained by the trustees, were not a little disappointed.
The expenditures necessary for the support of
the colony, became, at length, very onerous. The colony,
also, was disturbed by the hostility of the Spaniards on the
south, and nothing, under Divine Providence, but the wise
counsels and determined valor of General Oglethorpe, saved
it from destruction in the early part of its existence.</p>

<p>The tract of country west of the Delaware was, in
1681, granted to William Penn, son of the distinguished
Admiral Penn, as a reward for the services of his father.
The boundaries of the tract are definitely given us in the
charter, but are too minute to be here specified. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
whole region was afterwards called <span class="smcap">Pennsylvania</span>, constituting
a state of very large and regular dimensions. The
origin of the name is beautifully and ingeniously accounted
for, in a letter written by William Penn: "This day (January
5, 1681)," says he, "after many waitings, watchings,
solicitings, and disputes in the council, my country was
confirmed to me under the great seal of England, with
large powers and privileges, by the name of Pennsylvania;
a name the king would give it in honor of my father. I
chose New Wales, being a hilly country; and when the
secretary, a Welshman, refused to call it New Wales, I proposed
Sylvania, and they added Penn to it, though I much
opposed it, and went to the king to have it struck out. He
said 'twas past, and he would take it upon him; nor could
twenty guineas move the under secretary to vary the name;
for I feared it would be looked on as a vanity in me, and
not as a respect in the king to my father, as it really was.
Thou mayst communicate my grant to friends, and expect
shortly my proposals. 'Tis a dear and just thing, and my
God, that has given it to me through many difficulties, will,
I believe, bless and make it the seed of a nation. I shall
have a tender care to the government, that it be well laid
at first." And it was <i>well laid</i>. The territory was peaceably,
and by fair purchase, procured of the natives, and
though difficulties occasionally existed in the government,
which gave the proprietor considerable concern, yet the
colony enjoyed a career of prosperity for several successive
years. The effects of his magnanimity and justice were
especially visible in the early history of the colony.</p>

<p>Such, as briefly reviewed, is the history of the original
settlements of the <i>old thirteen United States</i>. The character
of the settlers, as well as their circumstances, were
various. They were from different nations in the old
world, though the great majority were of direct English
descent. But amidst the variety, there is a degree of uniformity,
a similar basis of institutions and principles has
obtained, and they have admirably coalesced in forming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
and sustaining one and a general government, amid their
several distinct state organizations&mdash;a government admirable
for its simplicity, freedom, exact equipoise, and liberal
compromises. The number of states is now more than
doubled, and ere long will probably be three-fold. Through
the Divine blessing, let it be perpetual!</p>

<p>At the period of the settlement of the English colonies
in America, savage tribes of Indians were scattered over
the country. In many respects, they possessed a similar
character, usages, and institutions&mdash;a bond of affinity running
through their several communities and tribes. As a
race of men, they were distinct from all the races found in
the old world. Their history was unknown, and to us, in
these times, dates no farther back than to the period of
European discovery here. They had, indeed, their traditions;
but these, like the traditions of all other nations, are
no farther entitled to credit than they are confirmed by
appearance or probable conjecture. If the hypothesis be
correct of the Asiatic origin of the Aborigines of America,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
by the way of Bherings straits, there would seem to be a
probability in the general account given of their migration
towards the east, and of their conquest of a more civilized
race, then occupying the country. Such a race seems to
have been once in existence, judging from the monuments
and relics that have been occasionally found among us.
They were called the Allegewi, and their more rude conquerors
styled themselves the Lenape and the Mengwe, or
the Iroquois. These seem chiefly to have divided the country
between them, after they had expelled the Allegewi. The
general name of the Delawares has since been given to the
former, and their language, called by the French, the
<i>Algonquin</i>. The Iroquois inhabited more the upper parts
of the country, along the lakes and the St. Lawrence.
The Lenape, or Delawares, extended themselves to the
south and east.</p>

<p>When our fathers came to these shores, they found here
the descendants of these savage conquerors. They were
entirely uncivilized, having, probably, undergone no process
of civilization, from the time of the migration of their
ancestors to the Mississippi and the Atlantic slope. As
distributed through the various parts of the thirteen original
states, they may be mentioned, as to their confederacies or
tribes, in the following order:</p>

<p>In the central and southern parts of New England there
were five principal tribes: the Wampanoags or Pokanokets,
the Pawtuckets, the Massachusetts, the Narragansets, and
the Pequods. The Pokanokets were the first known to the
English settlers. The territory inhabited by this tribe, was
that which now constitutes the south-eastern part of Massachusetts
and the eastern portion of Rhode Island. To the
chief of this tribe, who was Massasoit, at the time of the
English emigration, other smaller tribes were subject,
dwelling principally on the adjacent islands. His residence,
as also afterwards that of Philip his son, was at Montaup,
now Mount Hope, in Bristol, Rhode Island.</p>

<p>The tribe of Pawtuckets occupied the land upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
Merrimack near its mouth, as their principal seat, though
they extended themselves south until they came in contact
with the Massachusetts.</p>

<p>The Massachusetts were found about the bay which bears
the name of the tribe. They were bounded by the Pawtuckets
on the north, and the Pokanokets on the south.
Their head sachem held under his rule several smaller tribes,
some of which were known by the name of the Neponsetts,
the Nashuas, and the Pocumtucks. The acknowledged
sovereign of the confederacy, at the time of the English
settlement, was the widow of a powerful chief, styled
sometimes the "Massachusett's queen." They were situated
in a delightful region, where now stands the metropolis
of New England, with its cluster of noble towns in
the vicinity.</p>

<p>The tribe of the Narragansets held their chief seat on
the island of the Canonicut, in the bay called after their
name. Here, also, their grand sachem resided. They
extended west of the Pawcatuck river, where they came
into the neighborhood of the Pequods. The Pokanokets
bordered them on the east. They occupied a beautiful
country, and happily adapted to their mode of life, which
was fishing and hunting. Their disposition was more mild
and peaceable than usually appeared in the Indian character.
When the English arrived in that region, they found
there Canonicus, the grand sachem of the tribe, who proved
a benefactor of Rhode Island.</p>

<p>The tribe of Pequods were seated in the eastern part of
Connecticut, having the Narragansets on their eastern
border. They were a fierce and warlike race. Their
grand sachem, Sassacus, resided on the heights of Groton,
near the river called by their name, now the Thames.
Sassacus held the Mohegans subject to his authority.
These were a tribe occupying the place where Norwich
now stands. Uncas, the leader of the latter, joined the
whites in their war with the Pequods. These several
tribes, at the period referred to, were singularly diminished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
in number and power, on account of a wasting sickness,
which had been sent among them a few years before.</p>

<p>In the northern portion of New England, roved the
Indians whose general name was that of Tarenteens, or
Abenakis. They inhabited the coast of Maine throughout,
and extended into New Hampshire. Their character was
ferocious, and the settlers suffered severely from their wars,
murders, and depredations. Stealing in, at the dead of
night, upon the villages or dwellings, they burned and plundered,
indiscriminately, whatever came in their way&mdash;butchering
men, women, and children, without mercy.</p>

<p>The five tribes, or nations, that spread out east of Lake
Erie, and south of Lake Ontario, were the Iroquois, or
Mengwe, who had become thus divided, in consequence of
being pressed by the Hurons, and one or two other tribes,
inhabiting the St. Lawrence. They were called the Senecas,
Cayugas, Onondagas, Oneidas, and Mohawks. They
at length became a powerful race in their new abodes, and
not only overcame the Hurons, but made war upon the
Delawares, and were objects of dread far and near. The
most warlike community of the whole was said to be the
Mohawks. Their power and exactions reached east and
south, to a great distance.</p>

<p>The Indians, in the southerly portion of the country,
were of course earlier known to the English, than those
already mentioned&mdash;this was true of the tribes at least that
inhabited Virginia, of which there were more than forty in
number, in 1607. The nucleus of an entire confederacy,
inhabiting the territory from the sea-coast to the falls of
the rivers, was the Powhatan nation. This confederacy
included no less than thirty tribes, and the number of warriors
was estimated at eight thousand. The chief of the
same name, who figures so much in the history of Virginia,
was the great sachem of the confederacy. The seat of the
hereditary dominions was near the present site of the city
of Richmond. Here the noble Pocahontas was born, and
passed her early, uncultivated life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>The Indians who dwelt on the highlands, between the
falls of the rivers and the mountains, were divided into two
confederacies, not long after the arrival of the English.
One division consisted of the Monahoaks, in the eight tribes,
on the north. The other consisted of the Monacans, in five
tribes, stretching on the south into Carolina. The latter
went under the name of Tuscaroras, and connected with
the Iroquois.</p>

<p>Of the Indians in the southern extremity of the country,
the principal confederacies were the Creeks, whose locality
was mostly in Georgia&mdash;the Cherokees, who inhabited the
mountainous back country&mdash;and the Choctaws and Chickasaws,
who dwelt in the region between the mountains and
the Mississippi. Two or three other tribes occupied particular
localities, which need not be indicated.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Various speculations on the subject</span>&mdash;Opinions of Voltaire&mdash;Of Rev. Thomas
Thorowgood&mdash;Dr. Boudinot&mdash;Roger Williams&mdash;Hubbard&mdash;Thomas Morton&mdash;John
Josselin&mdash;Cotton Mather&mdash;Dr. Mitchell&mdash;Dr. Swinton.</p></blockquote>

<p>Although not in precise accordance with the plan of
this work, yet, on account of the interest which attaches to
the subject, we devote a few pages to an exposition of the
various theories advanced in relation to the <i>origin</i> of the
Indian tribes existing at the time the English settled the
country. These theories have been various, according to
the whims or predilections of the authors. Some have seen
in them an original species of the human race, unconnected
with any of the nations or tribes of the old world. Others
have fancied their resemblance to this or the other people,
ancient or modern, of the eastern continent&mdash;as Hebrews,
Trojans, Tartars, and the like.</p>

<p>Voltaire, and other skeptical writers, have accounted for
their origin, according to the first-named theory. They
have considered the Indian placed in America by the hand
of the Creator, or by nature&mdash;just as the buffalo, or the
tortoise, or any other animal, was placed there&mdash;or just as
trees and other products of vegetation, that are indigenous
to the soil. Thus they make no account of the apparent
scriptural doctrine of the unity of the human race&mdash;the
common descent from Adam.</p>

<p>The identity of the Indian with the Hebrew or the
Israelite has been conjectured by many. Rev. Thomas
Thorowgood, an author of the seventeenth century, held
that opinion, and endeavored to prove that the Indians were
the Jews, who had been lost in the world for the space of
near two thousand years. Adair, who claims to have
resided forty years among the southern Indians, published
a large quarto upon their origin, history, &amp;c. He endeavors
to prove their identity with the Jews, by showing the
similarity of their customs, usages, and language to those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
of the latter. The author of the Star in the West, Dr.
Boudinot, has followed the same thing, and thinks assuredly
that the Indians are the long-lost ten tribes of Israel.</p>

<p>Roger Williams, at one time, expressed the same opinion.
He writes, in a letter to friends in Salem, that the Indians
did not come into America from the north-east, as some had
imagined, for the following reasons: 1, Their ancestors
affirm that they came from the south-west, and return
thence when they die; 2, Because they separate their
women, in a little wigwam by themselves, at <i>certain
seasons</i>; and 3, Beside their god Kuttand, to the south-west,
they hold that Nanawitnawit (a God overhead) made
the heavens and the earth; and he avers, also, that he (the
writer) had found "some taste of affinity with the Hebrew."</p>

<p>The similarity of practices, or even of a number of terms
in a language, can, however, be no conclusive proof of
sameness of origin. It may be merely accidental, or in
respect to customs more particularly, may be owing to
similarity of circumstances. "Who will pretend that different
people, when placed under similar circumstances,
will not have similar wants, and hence similar actions? that
like wants will not prompt like exertions? and like causes
produce not like effects?" The slight resemblances existing,
or fancied to exist, between the Indians and the Israelites,
may be owing to a cause like the one pointed out. As to
the language of the Indians, Mr. William Wood, an old
writer, says: "Some have thought that they might be of
the dispersed Jews, because some of their words be near
unto the Hebrew; but, by the same rule, they may conclude
them to be of the gleanings of all nations, because
they have words after the Greek, Latin, French, and other
tongues."</p>

<p>Hubbard, an American historian, who wrote about 1680,
has this among other passages on the subject: "If any
observation be made of their manners and dispositions, it is
easier to say from what nations they did not, than from
whom they did derive their original. Doubtless their conjecture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
who fancy them to be descended from the ten
tribes of the Israelites, carried captive by the Salamaneser
and Esarhaddon, hath the least show of reason of any other,
there being no footsteps to be observed of their propinquity
to them more than to any other of the tribes of the earth,
either as to their language or manners."</p>

<p>Thomas Morton, an early New England historian, refers
their origin to the scattered Trojans, observing, "for after
that Brutus, who was the fourth from Æneas, left Latium,
upon the conflict held with the Latins, where, although he
gave them a great overthrow to the slaughter of their
grand captain, and many others of the heroes of Latium,
yet he held it more safely to depart unto some other place
and people, than by staying to run the hazard of an unquiet
life or doubtful conquest; which, as history maketh mention,
he performed. This people was dispersed there is no question,
but the people that lived with him, by reason of their
conversation with the Grecians and Latins, had a mixed
language that participated of both." Morton maintains
the great similarity of the languages of the Indians to the
Greek and Roman, as an instance of which, he fancied he
heard among their words Pasco-pan, and hence thinks
without doubt their ancestors were acquainted with the
god <i>Pan</i>!</p>

<p>A writer, Mr. John Josselin, who resided some time in
New England, towards the middle part of the seventeenth
century, pronounces the speech of the Mohawks to be a
dialect of the Tartars. He says "the north-east people
of America, that is, New England, &amp;c., are judged to be
Tartars, called Samoades, being alike in complexion, shape,
habit and manners."</p>

<p>That the Indians were Scythians, is an opinion expressed
in a decided manner by Cotton Mather. He was confirmed
in it, on meeting with this passage of Julius Cæsar: "Difficilis
invenire quam interficere," rendered by him, "It is
harder to find them than to foil them." Cæsar was speaking
of the Scythians, and the aptness of the language, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
expressing one peculiarity of the Indians in their warfare&mdash;their
sudden attacks and retreats&mdash;is noticeable.</p>

<p>Dr. S. L. Mitchell, of New York, a voluminous writer in
his day, thought that he had settled the question of the origin
of the Indians. They came, in his opinion, from the north-east
of Asia, and that is now, perhaps, the more common
belief. He thinks that they possessed originally the same
color, as that of the north-eastern nations of Asia.</p>

<p>Dr. Swinton, author of many parts of the Universal
History, after stating the different opinions of various
authors, who have advocated in favor of "the dispersed
people," the Ph&#339;nicians and other eastern nations, observes,
"that, therefore, the Americans in general were descended
from a people who inhabited a country not so far distant
from them as Egypt and Ph&#339;nicia, one will, as we apprehend,
readily admit. Now, no country can be pitched upon
so proper and convenient for this purpose, as the north-eastern
part of Asia, particularly Great Tartary, Siberia,
and more especially the peninsula of Kamschatka. That
probably was the tract through which many Tartarian
colonies passed into America, and peopled the most considerable
part of the new world."<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>The intercourse of the colonists in <span class="smcap">Virginia</span> with the
Indians, was not altogether such as to secure their friendship.
Difficulties arose, which were settled only by a resort
to wars and massacres. The earlier colonists either returned
to their native land, were destroyed by famine, or were cut
off by violence. The whole scheme of colonizing was, at
first, a series of mismanagement or misfortune. The earliest
attempt at settlement, under the Captains Amidas and Barlow,
in 1684, was abortive. It is related that the English,
after landing on an island, called by the Indians Wokokon,
saw none of the natives until the third day, when three
were observed in a canoe. One of them came on shore,
and the English went to him. He was not at all intimidated,
but spoke much to them, and then went fearlessly
on board the vessels. The whites, after making him some
presents, received some food in return. Wingina, chief of
the Indians in that place, never had much faith in the good
intentions of the English, and to him was mainly attributed
the breaking up of the colony. They were disposed to
return home, having made no serious attempt at settlement.</p>

<p>The next colony which proceeded to Virginia was conducted
by Sir Richard Grenville, in 1685. He had the
imprudence to commit an outrage upon the natives, which
occasioned at length the breaking up of the colony of one
hundred and eight men whom he left behind him. He
burned an Indian town, in revenge of a petty theft, which
some native committed upon him. Ralf Lane, who was
governor, became justly chargeable with very reprehensible
conduct. He put to death some of the natives on the most
frivolous charges, and it is no wonder that the animosity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
the Indians was aroused, and that the small band of adventurers
were so discomfited as to seek a return to England.</p>

<p>No attempt to settle Virginia had succeeded up to the
year 1607. The ill-advised schemes of the company or their
controversies, and the suspicions and hatred of the Indians,
had defeated every enterprise hitherto. But one man, Captain
Smith, by his sagacity and heroism, at length accomplished
the object. Of his adventures, no particular account
needs to be given here, as these have been narrated in
another part of this work. But his connection with Powhatan
affords the occasion of bringing the latter more especially
into view in this place. This chief is described as
being tall and well-proportioned, wearing an aspect of sadness&mdash;exceedingly
vigorous, and possessing a body fitted to
endure great hardships. At the time of the settlement of
Jamestown, he was about sixty years of age, and rendered
the more majestic by the grayness of his hair. He inspired
the awe of beholders as he was seated on his wooden form,
and adorned with his robe of racoon skins, and his headdress
of various feathers having the appearance of a crown.
He governed many nations, and many of them by the right
of conquest. The place of his residence, at first, was
at Powhatan, near the falls of James river; but, afterwards,
when he had extended his conquests north, it was at a place
called Werowocomoco. His dominion included the country
upon James river, from its mouth to the falls, and all its
tributary streams. This was the boundary of his country
southerly, and thus across the territory, "nearly as high as
the falls of all the great rivers over the Potowmack, even
to Patuxet in Maryland."</p>

   <p class="caption2">SMITH SELLING BLUE BEADS TO POWHATAN.</p>
</div>

<p>He usually kept a guard, consisting of forty or fifty of
his bravest men, especially when he slept, but this number
was four-fold after the arrival of the English. His wives
were numerous, and taken or dismissed at his pleasure.
When he slept, one sat at his head and another at his feet.
His places for temporary residence, or at certain seasons
of the year, were numerous. At these places he had victuals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a><br /><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
provided against his coming, in spacious wigwams
thirty or forty yards in extent. His manner of attack upon
his neighbors, was stealthy and fiercely cruel. An instance
is given, in his surprisal, on one occasion, of the people of
Payankatank, who were his neighbors and subjects. To
effect his barbarous purpose, he sent several of his men to
lodge with them the night on which he designed an attack;
then, secretly surrounding them in their wigwams, commenced
a horrid massacre. Many of the men were killed,
their scalps taken, and the women and children made prisoners.
The scalps were exhibited upon a line between two
trees as a trophy, and the chief of Payankatank and his
wife Powhatan became servants to the emperor.</p>

<p>Through Captain Smith's address, this prince was now
brought completely into the English interest; although
eventually, through the imprudent conduct of Newport,
who soon after arrived from England, he was induced to
practice deception upon his new friends, in the way of
trade. Smith, however, in his turn, took advantage of the
emperor, to the no great credit of his moral principles.
The revenge was complete, as the following example
shows; Smith gained his end fully, by pretending to set a
great value on a few blue beads, which he had exposed to
Powhatan as if by accident, and which he professed to be
very unwilling to part with, as they were worn, according
to his account, only by great kings. This fired the emperor
with the wish to secure them, at whatever sacrifice on his
part. In the infatuation produced, he parted with two or
three hundred bushels of corn, for a pound or two of beads.
Thus the intercourse of the whites with these simple children
of nature, in the early period of our history, was not
always marked with that delicate regard of right and
veracity, with which every transaction of this nature should
be attended. The consequences very naturally appeared
in the many plots and counter-plots which were contrived
to embarrass one another, or to effect unlawful objects.</p>

<p>On one occasion Powhatan became offended with Smith,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
because he could not procure swords from him in the manner
in which he procured them from Newport. When the
latter was about leaving the country, Powhatan sent him
twenty turkeys, for which he demanded and obtained
twenty swords in return. He supposed that he could do
the same with Smith, but was disappointed; and, accordingly
he ordered his men to seize the English wherever
they could find them. The consequence was, that many of
the latter, in the vicinity of the forts, were robbed of their
swords. These depredations were continued until Smith
surprised a number of the Indians, from whom he learned
that Powhatan was endeavoring to get all the arms in his
power, with a view to massacre the whites. When the
chief found that his plot was discovered, he sent Pocahontas,
his daughter, with gifts, in order to apologize for his conduct,
and pretended that the mischief was done by some of his
chiefs. He directed her to use her influence in effecting
the release of his men, in which she succeeded, and thus
the parties became at peace again.</p>

<p>The friendship which Powhatan manifested towards the
English at any time, was short-lived, and seems not to have
been at all sincere. Constant deceptions were practised
by him to gain his ends; and, so long as he lived, difficulties
existed between him and the English. The noble Pocahontas
was a sort of mediator between them, and often
brought important intelligence, as seasonable aid, to the
latter. On one occasion, after a long conference, in regard
to a trade in provisions, in which deceptions were employed
on both sides, and in which Powhatan endeavored to persuade
Captain Smith and his men to treat with him in a
friendly manner, and to throw aside their arms, Smith was
about to resort to force in order to effect his object. Powhatan,
however, succeeded in escaping from the conference,
and in conveying his women, children, and effects into the
woods. Even then he attempted to allure Smith into his
presence unarmed, if possible, by sending him a present.
Finding, at last, all artifices without effect, Powhatan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
resolved to fall upon the English in their cabins on the following
night. But here Pocahontas interposed her kind
offices, and was the means, most probably, of saving the
life of Smith and his attendants. She came alone, in a dark
night, through the woods, and apprised Smith of her
father's design. For such a favor, Smith offered her
whatever articles she would please to accept; but she
declined taking any thing, and, with tears in her eyes,
remarked, that if her father should see her with any thing,
he would suspect what she had done, and instantly kill her.
She then retired as she came, through the dismal forest.</p>

   <p class="caption2">Pocahontas coming in the night to tell Smith of the intended Massacre.</p>
</div>

<p>After Smith's final departure from Virginia, the emperor's
animosity against the whites was confirmed, as the English
successor in the government, Lord De la War, was much
less cautious and moderate in his measures with the Indians,
severe as Smith's treatment of them was at times. The
new governor, finding Powhatan not disposed to yield
to his demands, proceeded to an act of horrid barbarity.
Having got into his power an Indian prisoner, his lordship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
caused his right hand to be cut off. In this shocking condition
he sent the poor creature to Powhatan. At the same
time he gave the sachem to understand, that he would
serve all the Indians in that manner, if they refused obedience
any longer, and that he would destroy all the corn,
which was then near to the harvest. Powhatan, consequently,
could not but feel the most burning indignation
against the Englishman.</p>

<p>Two years after Smith left Virginia, that is, in 1611, Captain
Argal treacherously took the king's daughter prisoner,
with a view to prevent him from doing injury to the English,
as also to extort a large ransom from him, and such terms of
peace as they should prescribe. On being informed of the
captivity of Pocahontas, connected with the demand that
he should restore to the English their men, guns, and tools,
taken at different times by the Indians, the stern and wary
chief became greatly embarrassed, and knew not what to
do. They did not hear from him until at the expiration of
three months, when he complied with their demand only in
part. This did not satisfy Argal; the demand in full was
reiterated; but Powhatan was again, for a long time, silent.
The result was, that, in a year or two, Sir Thomas Dale
took Pocahontas to the residence of her father, in hopes to
effect an exchange, and bring about a peace. Powhatan
was absent from home, and the party met with no kindly
reception from the Indians, who seemed to take the presence
of the English in dudgeon. The latter burned many
of their Indian habitations, and gave out threats of other
vengeance. This had the effect of inducing some of the
Indians to come and make peace, as they called it. Pocahontas
had then an opportunity of seeing two of her
brothers, which gave her unbounded joy. After the marriage
of this excellent Indian woman to Mr. Rolfe, the
whites experienced less trouble from Powhatan; though it
is believed that they were never entirely exempt from the
effects of his policy or his power.</p>

<p>The successors of Powhatan were, first, Opitchapan, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
next, Opecancanough, both brothers of the emperor. Such
was the law of the succession. The first-named chief
seems never to have been noted for any distinguishing
quality, but is spoken of as being feeble and decrepid. He
compared unfavorably with his brother, who, in the council
and in the field, was the most conspicuous personage among
the Powhatans. He had, during the life-time of the late
emperor, procured from the free tribe of the Chickahominies
the title of their king.</p>

<p>It was Opecancanough who figured so disastrously in
the great massacre of the whites, on the 22d March, 1622,
which has been narrated in another place. It was kept a
profound secret during four years, and burst upon the settlement
like a bolt from heaven. In the vengeance, with
which the English followed this act of treachery and blood,
it was for some time supposed that Opecancanough was
among the killed; but if history does not misguide us, the
same sachem, twenty-two years afterwards, executed a still
greater massacre upon the English. It is not known how
long he had been plotting the extirpation of the whites, but
in 1644, all the Indians over the space of country six hundred
miles in extent, were joined in the enterprise. The
governor and council had appointed a fast-day to be kept
through the country upon Good-Friday for the success of
the king. On the day before the intended fast, Opecancanough,
borne in a litter, led his warriors forward, and commenced
the work of death. He was supposed to be near
one hundred years old at this time. The massacre commenced
in the out-parts of the circumjacent country, and
continued two days. The Indians fell suddenly upon the
inhabitants, and killed all indiscriminately, to the number of
three hundred. Their progress was checked by the arrival
of Sir William Berkley, at the head of an armed force.</p>

   <p class="caption2">Opecancanough borne in a litter to the Massacre of the Whites.</p>
</div>

<p>Subsequently to this massacre (the date has not been
ascertained), this bloody chief was taken prisoner. Sir
William intended to send him as a present to the king of
England. He was, however, prevented from doing it, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
the assassination of Opecancanough. The soldier who was
appointed to guard him, fired upon him, and inflicted a
mortal wound, it having been, as was supposed, an act of
private revenge. Just before the old chief expired, hearing
a great noise and crowd around him, he ordered an attendant
to lift up his eye-lids, as from age and fatigue the elasticity
of his muscles was in a great degree impaired, when he
discovered a multitude pressing around him, to gratify the
morbid desire of beholding a dying sachem. Aroused
with indignation, and little fearing death, he seemed to disregard
the crowd; but raising himself from the ground in
the spirit of his wonted authority, commanded that the
governor should be called to him. When the latter came,
the chief uttered in his hearing the impassioned remark:
"Had it been my fortune to have taken Sir William Berkley
prisoner, I would not meanly have exposed him as a
show to my people," and soon after expired. An Indian,
whom they afterwards had seized as prisoner, confessed
that they attempted this destruction of the English, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
they saw the latter "took up all their lands from them, and
would drive them out of the country, and they took this
season, for that they understood that they were at war in
England, and began to go to war among themselves."
These intrusions upon the Indian territory were, however,
conformable to the grants of the proprietors, the Indians.
Opecancanough could hardly have expected an entire conquest,
as his people had already begun to melt away, and
the villages of the English planters were springing up over
an extent of country of over five hundred miles, with a
comparatively large population.</p>

<p>Nickotawance succeeded Opecancanough as a tributary
to the English. In 1648, he came to Jamestown in company
with several other chiefs, and brought a number of beaver-skins
to be sent to the English king. He delivered a prolonged
address, which he concluded with the protestation,
"that the sun and moon should first lose their glorious lights
and shining, before he or his people should ever more wrong
the English."</p>

<p>The successor of this chief is supposed to have been
Totopotomoi, as he was king of Pamunkey in 1656. In
that year, a body of western or inland Indians, to the number
of six or seven hundred, came down from the mountainous
country, and took possession of the territory about the
falls of James river. This fact coming to the knowledge
of the legislature of Virginia, which was then in session, it
was resolved to dislodge the Indians from their new location,
as their situation and proximity were considered dangerous
to the whites. The war seems not to have been attended
with any success on the part of the colony. The English
leader, with one hundred men, and Totopotomoi with one
hundred of his warriors, suffered extremely in an engagement.
It appears, however, that a peace was not long after
concluded with the Indians.</p>

<p>A renowned warrior, Nemattanow, not having been mentioned
in the proper order of time, may be introduced here.
He was supposed to have had an agency in bringing about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
the great massacre of 1622. He was, however, an object
of jealousy to Opecancanough, the leader in that tragedy,
on account of his popularity among his countrymen. He
is said to have been an eccentric and vain person, being
wont "to dress himself up in a strange attire and barbaric
fashion with feathers," on which account he obtained the
name of Jack-of-the-feather. As he had been engaged in
many fights with the English, and, though particularly
exposed, had never received a wound, he was considered
by the Indians to be invulnerable. The cause and manner
of his fate were the following: "Only about fourteen days
before the massacre, Jack-of-the-feather went to the house
of one Morgan, where he saw many such articles exhibited
as were calculated to excite admiration in such people.
Jack, perhaps, had not the means to purchase, but it seems
he was resolved some how or other to possess them. He
therefore told Morgan that if he would take his commodities
to Pamunkey, the Indians would give him a great price for
them. Not in the least mistrusting the design of Nemattanow,
the simple Englishman set out for Pamunkey, in company
with this Indian. This was the last the English ever heard
of Morgan. However strange it may seem, Jack's ill-directing
fate sent him to the same place again; and, what
was still more strange, he had the cap of the murdered
Morgan upon his head. Morgan's servants asked him
where their master was, who very deliberately answered
that he was dead. This satisfied them that he had murdered
him. They therefore seized him, in order to take him before
a magistrate at Berkley; but he made a good deal of resistance,
which caused one of the captors to shoot him down.
The singular part of the tragedy is yet to be related.
Though mortally wounded, Nemattanow was not killed outright,
and his captors, which were two stout young men,
got him into a boat to proceed to Mr. Thorp's, the magistrate.
As they were going, the warrior became satisfied
that he must die, and with the most extraordinary earnestness,
besought that two things might be granted him. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
was, that it should never be told to his countrymen that
he was killed by a bullet; and the other, that he should
be buried among the English, so that it should never be
discovered that he had died, or was subject to death like
other men. Such was the pride and vanity exhibited by
an Indian at his death."<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>From the preceding brief notices of the hostile bearing
of the savage tribes towards the early Southern planters,
it will be apparent that the colonization of that portion of
America was no easy matter. The jealousy of the Indians
towards their new neighbors was soon excited; nor did
the conduct of the colonists serve to allay, but rather to
increase it. The cruelty and vindictiveness of the Indians
cannot be justified; but in their circumstances may be
found, perhaps, some small apology. This was their country:
they were proprietors of the soil. Here they lived:
here were their altars: here their fathers' sepulchres; and
they regarded them with the veneration and love of which
they were capable. Who can blame them? Who censure
those feelings&mdash;that patriotism&mdash;that love of liberty, which,
when found among civilized nations, are highly extolled?
Among the Indian chiefs, there were men of no small sagacity;
who, foreseeing the consequences to themselves and
people of the thrift and extension of the English&mdash;can it be
deemed strange that their anticipations were most sad? or
that they should adopt every expedient which seemed likely
to avert calamities to them most fearful?</p>

<p>In the early period of the settlements of New England,
the difficulties with the Indians were of less frequent occurrence,
than those which took place in the Virginia colony.
The providence of God had prepared the way for the
pilgrims to enter upon their wilderness inheritance. The
power of the Indians had been weakened by sickness, or
their dispositions softened, perhaps, in some cases, by their
adversities. There were instances, certainly, of singular
friendship toward the whites, on the part of these children of
nature, as was manifested in Samoset, Massasoit, and others.
But the character, objects, and policy of the pilgrims will
account, in part, for the comparative freedom from Indian
hostility which marked the early era of their settlement in
this land. As they came to enjoy and disseminate their
religion, they had no motive to irritate or disturb the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
aboriginal inhabitants. Wealth was not sought from them,
nor any greater portion of the soil than would suffice for
their wants, at the same time leaving to the Indian behind
the boundless wilderness, which alone he cared for. They
would have reclaimed him from heathenism, and taught him
religion, science, and the arts of civilised life, had he been
pleased to learn them. This was attempted, in some
instances, but the success, though a matter of gratitude,
was not at any time very considerable. The policy of the
fathers was to cultivate peace with all the Indian tribes; and
during many years, so far as the settlement of the eastern
shore was concerned, the object generally was effected.
Still occasionally difficulties would occur, and at length,
under a new set of chiefs, the notes of savage warfare rung
loud and long over the hills and vales of New England.
But we will here speak more particularly of the earliest
colony, Plymouth.</p>

<p>The first encounter had with the Indians, preceded the
disembarkation of the company of adventurers. It was a
select party of some fifteen or sixteen, who had landed with
a view to explore the country. Overtaken by night, they
set their watch, hoping doubtless to pass the night unmolested;
but about midnight they heard a hideous cry. The
cry then ceased, and it was then supposed that it had been
the noise only of wolves and foxes. About five o'clock,
however, they again heard a sudden and strange noise,
which they knew to be the same voices, though they varied
their notes. One of the company being abroad, came running
in, and cried, "They are men, Indians! Indians!" and
with this announcement came a shower of arrows. The
whites ran out with all speed to recover their arms. The
cry of the enemy was terrific, especially when they perceived
what the whites were about to do. Their arms
being secured, the Indians were ready to make an assault.
One, who appeared to be the leader of the latter, a stout
athletic man, stood behind a tree within a musket-shot, and
there let his arrows fly at the English. Three several shots<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
were poured in upon him without touching him&mdash;at length,
one seemed to take effect, as he bounded off, and his company
with him, yelling most hideously. It is not known
that any blood was shed in this encounter, though the
probability is, that the chief was wounded. Of the arrows
that were left on the field, several were picked up, and sent
as a curiosity to friends in England. Some of them were
ingeniously headed with brass, some with harts' horn, and
some with the claws of eagles.</p>

<p>An intercourse of an agreeable character between the
pilgrims and the natives soon commenced, by means of
<i>Samoset</i>, whose manner of introducing himself to the settlement
has been mentioned in another portion of this work.
The hospitality with which he was treated, secured his
friendship and confidence, and he communicated to the
settlers, in answer to their inquiries, whatever information
he possessed respecting the Indians and the country. He
is described by an early historian as having been a tall, strait
man, the hair of his head black, long behind, and short
before, none at all on his face. He ate and drank freely of
that which was offered him; and, although they wished his
absence at night, yet he was unwilling to leave, and they
could not do otherwise than keep and watch him. This
visit of the kind Samoset was an augury of good to the
colony. It seemed purely a providential event.</p>

<p>The visit continued only until the next morning, but was
repeated in the course of a day or two. His return then
brought to the acquaintance of the colony other Indians
who accompanied him. They were some of Massasoit's
men, whose object was to trade with the English. As
Samoset was charged not to let any who came with him
bring their arms, these, therefore, left their bows and
arrows at a distance from the place. They were entertained
in a fitting manner; they ate liberally of the English
victuals, and appeared very friendly; "sang and danced
after their manner like antics." They were dismissed as
soon as it could be done conveniently, without effecting any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
trade. Samoset, either being sick, or feigning himself so,
would not depart, and contrived to continue several days
longer. In this visit, some stolen articles were returned by
the Indians, through Samoset's influence.</p>

<p>At the next visit he made, he was accompanied by
Squanto, as once before related. The latter was said to
be the only native of Patuxet (the Indian name of Plymouth)
living there at that period. His captivity and residence
in England had prepared him, by understanding the
English language, to render service to the colony. Squanto,
it appears, was the only person that escaped the great sickness
at Patuxet. The extent of its ravages, as near as can
be judged, was from Narraganset bay to Kennebec, or, perhaps,
Penobscot, and is supposed to have commenced about
1617, and its continuance between two and three years, as
it was nearly abated in 1619. According to the account
of the Indians, it was a terrific scene, the deaths occurring
with such frequency, that the living were not able to bury
the dead. In the language of an author of the time, "they
died in heaps as they laid in their houses, and the living,
that were able to shift for themselves, would runne away,
and would let them dy, and let their carcasses ly above the
ground without buriall. For in a place where many inhabited,
there had been but one (referring to Squanto) left alive
to tell what became of the rest." When the pilgrims arrived
in this country, their bones were thick upon the ground in
many places. Squanto, with another Indian and several
Englishmen, was employed, on one occasion, to go in
search of an English boy, who had been lost in the woods.
Having been informed of some Indians that the boy was at
Nauset, they proceeded in a vessel to that place, joined also
by Iyanough, the sachem of Cummaquid, and two of his
men. Aspinet, the chief at Nauset, being informed by
Squanto that his English friends had come for the boy, he
came with a great train, and brought the boy with him, one
carrying him through the water. Not less than an hundred
Indians appeared on this occasion, half of whom attending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
the boy to the boat, the rest standing aloof, with their bows
and arrows, looking on. The child was delivered up in a
formal manner, covered with beads, and Aspinet embraced
the opportunity of making peace with the English, the latter
giving him a knife, as also one to the kind Indian who first
entertained the lost boy, and brought him to Nauset.</p>

<p>Squanto had shown his early attachment to the English,
in his conduct towards Captain Dermer, who visited the
country the year before the pilgrims arrived here. When
the Indians would have killed him on some occasion,
Squanto successfully pleaded in his behalf. They had in
view the avenging of some murders, which a foreigner, an
Englishman, had a while before inflicted on their people.
These two Indians, Samoset and Squanto, remained with
the English, instructing them how to live in their country.
Squanto became an important personage in the Indian politics.
He was in the main friendly to the English; but his
devices to enhance himself in the eyes of his new friends,
or to make himself great in the eyes of his countrymen,
were not always wise, and were not, unfrequently, mischievous.
In 1622 he forfeited his life by plotting to
destroy that of Massasoit. On that occasion, the latter
went to Plymouth, burning with rage against Squanto, but
the governor succeeded in quieting him for that time.
Soon after, he sent a messenger to entreat the governor's
consent to his being put to death; but the latter would not
be persuaded to yield to his request. Squanto denied all
knowledge of the plot. The English, however, seemed
well satisfied that Squanto had laid this shallow scheme to
set them against Massasoit, thinking they would destroy
him, by which means he expected to become chief sachem
himself; and this seems the more probable, as Massasoit
was, for some time, irreconcilable, because they withheld
Squanto from him. When the English understood his
object, they assured the Indians that they did not concur in
the plot, and that they would do no injury to them, unless
the Indians began with the whites. Squanto was sharply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
reproved by the governor, but he was so necessary to the
welfare of the colony, in respect to its intercourse with the
Indians, that he was retained there.</p>

<p>The following instance is related of his man&#339;uvres to
possess his countrymen with great fear of the English: He
told them that the English kept the plague buried in one of
their store-houses, and that they could send it at any time
to any place, to destroy whatever persons or people they
would, though they themselves stirred not out of doors.
This piece of information was of course calculated to
inspire them with great terror. Some sagacious Indians at
length discovered the trick, by inquiring of the English
respecting it.</p>

<p>Squanto died during an expedition or trading voyage,
which was undertaken among the Indians of Cape Cod, to
buy corn in a time of scarcity. He was pilot on this occasion.
He was seized with sickness in the midst of the
undertaking, his disorder being a fever, and he bleeding
much at the nose, which the Indians reckon a fatal symptom,
the disease soon overpowered him. He desired
the governor would pray for him, that he might go to
the Englishman's God. He bequeathed his effects to
sundry of his English friends, as remembrances of his
affection.</p>

<p>"Thus died the famous Squanto, or Tisquantum, in December,
1622. To him the pilgrims were greatly indebted,
although he often, through extreme folly and short-sightedness,
gave them, as well as himself and others, a great deal
of trouble."</p>

<p>One of the most interesting personages of Indian history
is Massasoit, already spoken of incidentally. His visit
to the pilgrims had been previously announced through
Samoset and Squanto. He was chief of the Wampanoags,
and resided at a place called Pokanet by the Indians, which
is now included in the town of Bristol, Rhode Island. He
was a friend to the English, and persevered in his friendship
to the last. His renown was more in peace than in war, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
is for that reason more precious in the memory of the
wise and virtuous.</p>

<p>"It has often been thought strange that so mild a sachem
as Massasoit should have possessed so great a country, and
our wonder has been increased, when we consider that
Indian possessions are generally obtained by prowess and
great personal courage. We know of none who could
boast of such extensive dominions, where all were contented
to consider themselves his friends and children. Powhatan,
Pontiac, Little Turtle, Tecumseh, and many more that we
could name, have swayed numerous tribes; but theirs was
a temporary union in an emergency of war. That Massasoit
should be able to hold so many tribes together, without
constant war, required qualities belonging only to a few.
That he was not a warrior, no one will allow, when the
testimony of Annawon is so direct to the point; for that
great chief gave Captain Church an account of what
mighty success he had formerly in the wars against many
nations of Indians, when he served Asuhmequin (Massasoit),
Philip's father."</p>

<p>The limits of his country cannot be exactly pointed out,
as occasionally the Nipmucks, or inland Indians, owned his
sway, and at other times that of the Narraganset sachem.
He possessed at least Cape Cod, and all that part of Massachusetts
and Rhode Island, between Massachusetts and
Narraganset bays, extending into the interior to some distance
between Pawtucket and Charles rivers. The distance
is not accurately known. This chief had several places of
residence, but the favorite one would appear to have been
Mount Hope. It has always been deemed a picturesque
and beautiful locality. The Indian name, Pokanoket, signifies
the wood or land on the other side of the water.
There was a place in Middleborough, and another in Raynham,
where Massasoit spent some parts of the year, probably
the summer.</p>

<p>It was of course in Massasoit's country that the pilgrim
fathers had arrived. With their object, and the nature of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
their movement, he could not be supposed to be acquainted.
These points he made some attempts to ascertain, by sending
occasionally some of his men to the settlement at Plymouth.
It was in this way that his introduction to the
English was brought about, the visit of Samoset and
Squanto being the preparation for the event. It was on
the 22d of March, 1621, that the great sagamore, with
Quadequina, his brother, made his appearance before them.
Much caution was observed by each party in respect to the
meeting, as they were uncertain of one another's views.
But presents were made to the Indians, and much good will
was expressed. The following description of the scene has
been given: "As Massasoit proceeded to meet the English,
they met him with six soldiers, who saluted each other.
Several of his men were with him, but all left their bows
and arrows behind. They were conducted to a new house
which was partly finished, and a green rug was spread on
the floor, and several cushions for Massasoit and his chiefs
to sit down upon. Then came the English governor, followed
by a drummer and trumpeter, and a few soldiers,
and, after kissing one another, all sat down. Some strong
water being brought, the governor drank to Massasoit, who
in his turn drank a great draught, that made him sweat all
the while after. They now proceeded to make a treaty,
which stipulated that neither Massasoit nor any of his
people should do hurt to the English, and that if they did,
they should be given up to be punished by them; and that
if the English did any harm to him or any of his people,
they (the English) would do the like to them." Massasoit
is represented as having trembled much on the occasion,
through his fear of the English. This was his first visit to
the infant colony, and its consequences seem to have been of
the most propitious character. He ever afterwards treated
the English with kindness, and the compact was followed
by a long period of peace.</p>

<p>The only exception to his feelings of friendship for the
new comers, arose from the affair of Squanto, as has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
already detailed. Massasoit could not but feel aggrieved;
but a sort of necessity seemed to be laid upon them to
secure the good offices of Squanto, and they could not
know, perhaps, how far he was implicated in wrong.
Indeed, it is stated that at one time they were about to
deliver up Squanto to Massasoit's men, but that the latter,
in their impatience at the delay, went off in a rage.</p>

<p>Sometime during the next summer, Massasoit was visited
by several of the English, among whom were Mr. Edward
Winslow, Mr. Stephen Hopkins, and Squanto, their interpreter.
The object they had in view was to ascertain his
place of residence, in the event of having to call on him
for assistance, to cement and continue their begun friendship,
and particularly to induce him to restrain his men in
regard to their visits to the colony, as it was a time of
scarcity, and they could not afford to support such vagabonds.
They took presents with them, in order to render
their visit agreeable to the sagamore, and such was the
effect produced. Massasoit was absent at the time, but,
being immediately sent for, he soon returned to meet his
guests. The report of their guns, upon hearing he was on
the way, frightened the Indian women and children to such
a degree, that they all fled; but their salutation in the same
manner to Massasoit as he drew near, very greatly elated
him. He welcomed his guests with kindness, and took
them into his house; but they had sorry accommodations
and scanty fare. Except tobacco for smoking, their entertainment
for the first night was only a supperless bed, as he
had no victuals to give them. Their bed, if it might be so
called, consisted only of planks, raised a foot from the
ground, with a thin mat upon them, with a mixed company
to occupy it, so that they were "worse weary of" their
"lodgings, than of" their "journey." After fasting two
nights and one day, they partook of a scanty, but "timely"
meal of boiled fish. In the language of the times, it is
related: "Very importunate was he to have us stay with
them longer. But we desired to keep the Sabbath at home,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
and feared we should either be light-headed for the want
of sleep&mdash;for what with bad lodging, the savages' barbarous
singing (for they used to sing themselves to sleep),
lice, and fleas, within doors, and musketoes without, we
could hardly sleep all the time of our being there&mdash;we much
fearing that if we should stay any longer, we should not be
able to recover home for want of strength. So that on
Friday morning, before the sun rising, we took our leave
and departed, Massasoit being both grieved and ashamed
that he could no better entertain us."</p>

   <p class="caption2">Governor Winslow's visit to Massasoit during his sickness.</p>
</div>

<p>A sickness with which this sachem was seized, in 1623,
occasioned another visit on the part of Mr. Winslow. He
had been sent for by the chief to visit him in his distress,
accompanied by "one Master John Hampden," then on a
visit to the colony, and he took with him medicines and
cordials, such as were deemed necessary. As it was a
custom, among the Indians, for all the friends of a chief to
attend on such occasions, Mr. Winslow found on his arrival
that the house was filled with people. They were noisily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
engaged in practicing their charms or powows, and all was
confusion and uproar&mdash;a poor sedative, surely, for a sick
man. To keep heat in him, some half dozen women were
busily employed in chafing his arms, legs, and thighs.
When they had made an end of their incantations, the
chief was told that his friends, the English, were come to
see him. Unable to see, but learning who it was, he
desired to speak with Mr. Winslow. The interview was
touching in no small degree, and especially as Massasoit
said: "O, Winsow, I shall never see thee again." Like
other Indians, he could not articulate the liquid <i>l.</i> By Winslow's
kind exertions, however, his sickness began to abate,
and the sachem finally recovered, contrary to the expectations
of himself and all his friends.</p>

<p>For this attention of the whites, he ever felt grateful,
viewing it as the means of his recovery. He gave a
striking proof of his appreciation of the favor shown him,
even before the departure of Winslow, by informing
Hobomok of a plot laid by some of his subordinate chiefs
for the purpose of destroying the two English plantations.
This he charged him to make known to the English, which
was done. Massasoit mentioned, at the same time, that he
had been urged to join in it, or give his consent to the plan;
but that he had steadily opposed it. The evils which that
plot brought upon its authors, will be seen in another place.</p>

<p>Massasoit manifested a great desire for the welfare of
his people, as appeared from his inducing Mr. Winslow to
go among them, in the midst of a prevailing sickness, and
administer to them the medicines and cordials which had
proved so efficacious in his own case. This, his paternal
regard for his people, raised him still higher in the estimation
of the English. Many Indians, before Mr. Winslow
left, came to see their chief; some probably from a distance
of an hundred miles.</p>

<p>A war, which commenced in 1632, between Massasoit
and Canonicus, the sachem of the Narragansets, was speedily
terminated by the interference of the English in behalf<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
of their benefactor. Captain Miles Standish led the force,
and accomplished the object with little bloodshed, although
the Indians expected a serious contest.</p>

<p>Massasoit showed his kind feeling towards Mr. Williams,
in giving up the lands in dispute between him and the Narraganset
sachem, since Mr. Williams had bought and paid
for all he possessed of the latter. His title was precarious
so long as Massasoit laid claim to the territory, as it would
then be considered as being within the jurisdiction of Plymouth.
The land thus given up, included that which is the
island called Rhode Island, Prudence island, and perhaps
some others, together with Providence. Agreeably to
Massasoit's advice, in regard to the Indian plot for the
massacre of the whites, already referred to, that a bold
stroke should be struck, and the heads of the plot destroyed,
the daring Standish, with a party of only eight men, went
into the hostile country to effect the object. The party
intended secresy, but the Indians in some way obtained
knowledge of it, or mistrusted Standish's design. Accordingly,
they began to prepare for the conflict. One of them,
Pecksuot, a man of great courage, called a <i>paniese</i>, told
Hobomok, <i>he understood the captain was there to kill him
and the rest of the Indians there</i>. "Tell him," said Pecksuot,
"we know it, but fear him not, neither will we shun
him." By their conduct before the English, in sharpening
their knives and in their insulting gestures and speeches,
they showed how little apprehension they entertained,
especially as the English were so inconsiderable in number.
Pecksuot even told Standish, that though he were a great
captain, yet he was but a little man, and that he himself,
though he was no sachem, yet was a man of great strength
and courage. Standish little heeded what was said, but
watched his opportunity, as the parties were in a house
together. After considerable man&#339;uvring, he could get
advantage over but a few of the Indians. At length, having
got Pecksuot and Wittuwamat, a bloody Massachusetts'
chief, both together, with another man and a youth, brother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
to Wittuwamat, and like him in character; and having about
as many of his own company in the same room, he gave
the word to his men to commence the work. The door
was at once made fast, and Standish himself began the
terrible contest. Snatching from Pecksuot his own knife
from his neck, though with a desperate struggle, he pierced
with it the athletic Indian, and brought him to the floor.
The rest killed Wittuwamat and the other man, and took
the youth, whom the captain caused to be hanged. After
this, other encounters were had with the scattered Indians,
and some three more were also killed.</p>

<p>In justice to the savages, it is worthy of remark, that they
were provoked to the conspiracy for which they were so
severely dealt with, by the unauthorized aggressions of
Weston's men, a colony of sixty Englishmen, who had come
over a year or two before, under the direction of Thomas
Weston. He was at first a friend of the pilgrims, but
became at length their traducer. This company, after
living upon the ill-supplied settlers at Plymouth through
the winter of 1621-22, had made at Weymouth an inexpedient
settlement. The pilgrims prosecuted this bloody
enterprise, under the excitement produced by the horrible
intelligence from Virginia of the great Indian massacre in
that colony. In view of this bloody tale, we cannot but
regret the necessity which our fathers felt for engaging in
such a work; and we cannot but be touched with the piety
and humanity of the godly Mr. Robinson, the father of the
Plymouth church, in consequence of the present affair, that
"it would have been happy if they had converted some
before they had killed any."</p>

<p>Between the years 1649 and 1657, Massasoit sold to the
English, at different times, various tracts of land for a
valuable consideration. Indeed, being entirely subservient
to the English, he claimed to hold little or nothing of his
own at length, and ceased to act in his own name. He
therefore scarcely appears in the records of the colony,
during the three or four last years of his life. He died, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
is believed, in 1662, his son Alexander dying also the same
year. Another son, the celebrated Philip, succeeded him.
Even Massasoit could be guilty of an Indian trick, as the
following instance, related by Governor Winthrop, evinces:
Mr. Winslow, on returning from a trading voyage southward,
left his vessel, and, traveling by land, called on his old
friend Massasoit, who agreed to accompany him during the
remainder of the journey. While they were on the way,
Massasoit sent on one of his men forward to Plymouth, for
the purpose of surprising the people, by the announcement
of Winslow's death. As the declaration was believed at
Plymouth, from the manner in which the account was given,
it produced unmingled grief at the settlement. But shortly,
what was their astonishment at seeing him alive, in company
with his Indian friend. When it was known that the sachem
had caused the sad news to be conveyed to them, they
demanded the reason of his conduct in practising such a
deception. He gave as a reply, that he might be more
welcome when he did return, and that such things were
customary with his people.</p>

<p>Of Caunbitant, as one of the Indian chiefs in that region,
something deserves to be said. He was one of the most
renowned captains within the dominions of Massasoit.
The place of his residence was Mettapoiset, in the present
town of Swansey. He ever looked upon the English with
a jealous eye, considering them as enemies and intruders on
the soil, and his plans appeared to be shaped for the destruction
of the strangers, as soon as he could find a fitting
occasion. In the summer of 1621, he was supposed to be
in the interests of the Narragansets, and plotting with
them to overthrow Massasoit. He had much also to say
against the English, and the peace concluded between
Nauset, Cummaquid, and the latter. Against Squanto and
Hobomok he indulged a deadly enmity. Discovering, on
one occasion, the house where Squanto was, he set a guard
around it, and secured him. Hobomok, seeing that Squanto
was taken, and Caunbitant holding a knife to his throat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
being a strong man broke away from them, and came to
Plymouth, with the news of Squanto's probable death.
Upon this, the people sent an expedition of fourteen men,
under Standish, to rectify matters. After much toil, this
small handful of men arrived at the place where they
expected to find Caunbitant. They beset the house, and
demanded of the chief if he were there. The savages
seemed to be struck dumb with fear. Upon being assured
that they sought only Caunbitant, and that every Indian
was safe who would be still, they at length, though a few
of them endeavored to escape, told the assailants that
Caunbitant was returned home with his whole train, and
that Squanto was yet living, and in the town. The attack
being made in the night, carried terror to the hearts of the
Indians, as in the affray a couple of guns were discharged,
some of them never having heard the report of fire-arms
before. While the English were searching the house,
Hobomok got on the top of it, and called Squanto and
another Indian, Tokamahamon, whom they sought. They
both appeared in a short time, together with several others,
some armed and others naked. The captured wigwam was
held until daylight, when the prisoners were released, and
the little army marched into the town of the Namaskets.
Here it seems Squanto had a house to which they went,
and where they took breakfast. The issue of the whole
was, the giving out of a decree from the court that they
held, in which they warned Caunbitant of the consequences
of offering violence to Tisquantum, Hobomok, or any of
Massasoit's subjects. Caunbitant seemed from this time to
lay aside his enmity to the English, or at least his open
opposition, as on the 13th of September following he went to
Plymouth, and signed a treaty of amity, together with others.
The English nevertheless always doubted his sincerity.</p>

<p>What became of this sachem is not known to history.
His name appears no more on record after 1623, and it
is supposed that he either fled his country, or died about
that time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>Hobomok, already spoken of occasionally in the story of
others, deserves a more particular notice. He was a notable
warrior, who came to Plymouth about the end of July, 1621,
and remained with the English to the close of his life. He
was the principal means of the lasting friendship of Massasoit,
which he took much pains to promote. Esteemed by
his own countrymen for his prowess and valor, he was
extremely serviceable to the colonists, by teaching them
how to cultivate the fruits and grains peculiar to the country.
The latter had no reason to apprehend treachery on
his part, as Hobomok was a favorite of Massasoit, and one
of his principal captains, and was entirely in their interest.
The following incident strengthened them in their opinion:
The Massachusetts Indians had, for some time, been inviting
the settlers into their country to trade for furs. When in
March, 1622, they began to make ready for the voyage,
Hobomok told the people that he feared the Massachusetts
were joined in confederacy with the Narragansets, and
that they therefore would seize upon this occasion to cut
off Captain Standish and his company abroad; and also, in
the mean while, it was to be feared that the Narragansets
would attack the town at home, giving reasons for his
apprehensions, declaring also that Tisquantum was in the
confederacy. He intimated that the latter would use many
persuasions to draw the people from their shallops, that the
Indians might take advantage of their situation.</p>

<p>They, however, proceeded on their voyage, but had not
reached a great distance before a false messenger came
running into Plymouth, apparently in great agitation. He
informed them that Caunbitant, with many of the Narragansets,
and he believed Massasoit with them, were on their
way in order to cut off the English. The story was unhesitatingly
believed, and their instant purpose was to bring
back Captain Standish, who had just left in the boat with
Hobomok. The discharge of a cannon from the town
brought the company back. They had no sooner arrived
than Hobomok assured them there was no truth in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
report, and said it was a plot of Squanto's, who was then in
one of the boats. He knew that as to Massasoit, that chief
would not engage in such an enterprise without consulting
him. Although there was reason to believe this, or at least
to confide in the sincerity of Hobomok, yet, as related in
another place, the English saw fit to connive at Squanto's
practices. "Hobomok was greatly beloved by Massasoit,
notwithstanding he became a professed Christian, and Massasoit
was always opposed to the English religion himself.
He was the pilot of the English when they visited Massasoit
in his sickness, whom before their arrival they considered
dead, which caused great manifestations of grief in Hobomok.
He often exclaimed, as they were on the way, 'My
loving sachem! my loving sachem! many have I known, but
never any like thee.' Then turning to Mr. Winslow, said:
'While you live, you will never see his like among the
Indians, that he was no liar, nor bloody and cruel, like other
Indians. In anger and passion, he was soon reclaimed, easy
to be reconciled towards such as had offended him; that his
reason was such as to cause him to receive advice of
mean men; and that he governed his people better with
few blows than others did with many.' In the division of
the land at Plymouth, among the inhabitants, Hobomok
received a lot as his share, on which he resided after the
English manner, and died a Christian among them. The
year of his death does not appear, but was previous
to 1642."<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>The Narragansets were considered a great nation among
the Indians. The territory of their sachem extended about
thirty or forty miles from Sekunk river and Narraganset
bay, including Rhode Island and other islands in that bay.
Pawcatuck river separated it from the Pequods. Under
the rule of Canonicus, in 1642, this nation was at the height
of its greatness, and was supposed to embrace a population
of thirty thousand inhabitants. He was sachem of the
tribe at the time of the landing of the fathers on the shores
of New England, and continued in this capacity to the time
of his death, in 1647. He died, it is believed, at a very
advanced age. At the period of the settlement of Plymouth,
the Wampanoags were in great fear of the Narragansets,
and at one time war actually existed. During its
continuance, Massasoit fled before Canonicus, and sought
the protection of the English.</p>

<p>The Narragansets, at an early period, were not disinclined
to seek a quarrel with the English. In view of the
weakness of the latter, they began to utter threats, although
the summer preceding they had desired and obtained
peace. They deemed it a favorable opportunity for their
purpose, as the English had just received an addition to
their numbers, but not to their arms or provisions&mdash;a circumstance
of which the Indians were advised. Their
desire, or intention, was definitely made known by the
following significant circumstance: In February, 1622,
Canonicus sent a man, accompanied by one Tokamahamon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
a friendly Indian, into Plymouth, bringing with him a bundle
of arrows, bound with a rattle-snake's skin, and, leaving
them there, immediately left the place. When Squanto
was made acquainted with the incident, he informed the
English that it was a challenge for war. The governor
(Bradford) taking the rattle-snake's skin, and filling it with
powder and shot, returned it to Canonicus. At the same
time, he instructed the messenger to bid him defiance, and
dare him to the combat. This had the desired effect upon
the Indian sachem. He refused to receive the skin, as also
the other chiefs, until it was at last returned to Plymouth.
Canonicus was evidently awed by the hostile bearing and
threat of the English.</p>

   <p class="caption2">Governor Bradford and the Snake-skin.</p>
</div>

<p>Not long after this affair, the Pequods proposed to the
Narragansets to join them in rooting out the English: on
the ground that if the Pequods were once destroyed, the ruin
of the Narragansets was sure to follow. The English would
want their lands. They were spreading fast. But a timely
combination would save both tribes and their inheritance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
On these politic representations, the historian Hubbard
cleverly remarks that, "Machiavel himself, if he had sat in
council with them, could not have insinuated stronger reasons
to have persuaded them to a peace." It is said that
the Narragansets felt the force of them, and were almost
persuaded to accede to the proposal, and to join with the
others against the English; but when they considered what
an advantage they had put in their hands, by the power
and favor of the English, to take full revenge of all their
former injuries upon their inveterate enemies, the thought
of that was so sweet, that it decided their hesitating minds.</p>

<p>The governor of Massachusetts, in order to prevent a
union between these savage nations, and to strengthen the
bands of peace between the Narraganset Indians and the
colony, sent for Miantonimoh, who was their sachem in
connection with Canonicus, inviting him to come to Boston.
Upon this, Miantonimoh, together with two of the sons of
Canonicus, another sachem, and a number of their men,
went to Boston, and entered into a treaty to the following
effect: That there should be a firm peace between them
and the English and their posterity&mdash;that neither party
should make peace with the Pequods without the consent
of the other&mdash;that they should not harbor the Pequods&mdash;and
that they should return all fugitive servants, and deliver
over to the English, or put to death, all murderers. The
English were to give them notice when they went out
against the Pequods, and they were to furnish them with
guides. It was also stipulated that a free trade should be
maintained between the parties.</p>

<p>These articles were indifferently well observed by the
Narragansets till their enemies, the Pequods, were totally
subdued; but after that event, they began to grow insolent
and treacherous, especially Miantonimoh himself. The
English seem always to have been more favorably disposed
towards other tribes than to the Narragansets, as appears
from the interest they took in the wars between them and
their enemies. As long as the other tribes succeeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
against them, the English took no part in the contests; but
whenever the Narragansets prevailed, they were ready
to intercede.</p>

<p>After the period of the Pequod war, in 1637, the Narragansets
were the most numerous and powerful of the Indian
tribes in this part of the country. Conscious of their power,
and discontented that the whole sovereignty over the rest of
the Indians was not adjudged to belong to them, or envious
that Uncas, the chief sachem of the Mohegans, had gained
the favor of the English more than themselves, they constantly
sought occasions of disagreement with the Mohegans.
This was in contravention of an agreement made
between the English and the Narragansets, in the year
1637, when they had helped to destroy the Pequods, and
also the triple league between the English, Mohegans, and
Narragansets, entered into at Hartford in 1638. The Narragansets
seemed to owe a special spite against Uncas and
the Mohegans, from the time of the distribution of the
Pequods after the termination of the war. They had
probably expected the whole management of that affair for
themselves. They therefore found occasions of quarrel
with Uncas, and were hardly kept from making open war
with him, when they saw all other attempts to destroy him
by treachery, poison, and sorcery had failed. The Mohegans,
though a less numerous and powerful people than the
Narragansets, were yet more warlike in character and
more politic in their intercourse with the whites.</p>

<p>The disposition of Miantonimoh was haughty and aspiring,
and he seemed to infuse the same spirit into the minds
of his people. He possessed a fine figure, was tall of stature,
and was a master of cunning and subtlely. It was
strongly suspected that, in the year 1642, he had contrived
to draw all the Indians throughout the country into a
general conspiracy against the English. Letters from Connecticut,
received at Boston, had announced the existence
of such a conspiracy, and even the details of it were given.
The time appointed for the assault was said to be after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
harvest&mdash;the manner, to be by several companies entering
into the houses of the principal men, professedly for the
purposes of trade, and then to kill them there; one company
seizing their arms, and others being at hand to
prosecute the massacre. It was urged on the part of
Connecticut, that war should be begun with them, and
that if Massachusetts would send one hundred and twenty
men to Saybrook, at the mouth of the river, they would
meet them with a proportionable number. Though there
was a probability in the stories afloat, respecting the Narragansets,
yet the general court of Massachusetts did not
think the information to be a sufficient ground for commencing
a war. The court, however, ordered that the
Indians within their jurisdiction should be disarmed, and to
this they willingly assented. The sachem of the Narragansets
was, moreover, sent for to Boston, and, by his
readiness to appear, confirmed the English in the opinion
that nothing had as yet occurred which could be construed
into a justifiable cause of war. The sachem's quarrel
with the Mohegans would very naturally render them a
subject of such a report, whether there was a foundation
for it or not.</p>

<p>Miantonimoh very consistently urged before the court,
that his accusers should be confronted to him, and their
allegations sifted, so that the truth might be ascertained&mdash;that
if they could not prove their charges, they might
receive the punishment which was their due, and which
would have been inflicted on himself if found guilty, that
is, death&mdash;and that as the English must have believed the
report, because they ordered the disarming of the Indians,
so equity required that they who accused him, should be
punished according to the offence charged upon his own
person. He, moreover, engaged to prove that the report
was raised by Uncas himself, or some of his people. On
the part of English, the disarming of the Indians was
excused on the ground that Englishmen's houses had been
robbed in several instances by the Indians, which was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
consideration that somewhat satisfied the chief. The Connecticut
people yielded, though with reluctance, to the
decision of the Massachusetts court.</p>

<p>They spent two days in making a treaty of peace, the
delay being occasioned by the difficulty of obtaining Miantonimoh's
consent to a portion of the stipulations. It was,
however, effected to the satisfaction of the English. Indian
hostages were given for its performance, and, excepting a
company stationed in the Mohegan country for the protection
of Uncas, the whites laid aside warlike preparations.</p>

<p>In the year 1643, Miantonimoh invaded the Mohegans
with nine hundred of his warriors; Uncas met him at the
head of five hundred of his men, on a large plain; both
prepared for action, and advanced within bow-shot. Before
the conflict commenced, Uncas advanced singly, and thus
addressed his antagonist: "You have a number of men
with you, and so have I with me. It is a pity that such
brave warriors should be killed in a private quarrel between
us. Come like a man, as you profess to be, and let us fight
it out. If you kill me, my men shall be yours; but if I kill
you, your men shall be mine." Miantonimoh replied:
"My men came to fight, and they shall fight." Uncas had
before told his men, that if his enemy should refuse to fight
with him personally, he would fall down, and then they
were to discharge their missiles on the Narragansets, and
fall upon them as fast as they could. This was accordingly
done. Uncas instantly fell upon the ground, and his men
poured a shower of arrows upon Miantonimoh's army, and
with a horrible yell advanced rapidly upon them, and put
them to flight. Uncas and his men pressed on, driving
them down ledges of rock, and scattering them in every
direction. Miantonimoh was overtaken and seized by
Uncas, who, by a shout, called back his furious warriors.
About thirty Narragansets were slain, among whom were
several noted chiefs. Finding himself in the hands of his
implacable enemy, Miantonimoh remained silent, nor could
Uncas, by any art, force him to break his sullen mood.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
"Had you taken me," said the conqueror, "I should have
asked you for my life." No reply was made by the indignant
chief, and he submitted without a murmur to his
humiliating condition. He was afterwards conducted to
Hartford, by his conqueror, and delivered to the English,
by whom he was held in duress until his fate should be
determined by the commissioners of the colonies. After an
examination of his case, the commissioners resolved, "that
as it was evident that Uncas could not be safe while
Miantonimoh lived, but either by secret treachery or open
force his life would be constantly in danger, he might justly
put such a false and blood-thirsty enemy to death; but this
was to be done out of the English jurisdiction, and without
cruelty or torture." Miantonimoh was delivered to Uncas,
and by a number of his trusty men was marched to the
spot where he was captured, attended by two Englishmen
to see that no torture was inflicted, and the moment he
arrived at the fatal place, one of Uncas' men came up
behind, and with his hatchet split the skull of the unfortunate
chief. The body was buried on the spot, and a heap
of stones piled upon the grave. The place since that time
has been known by the name of <i>Sachem's plain</i>, and is
situated in the town of Norwich, in Connecticut.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>The Narragansets, as was to be expected, ever afterwards
bore an implacable malice against Uncas and all
the Mohegans, and also for their sakes secretly against the
English, so far as they dared to discover it. But the death
of Miantonimoh, and the preparation for the invasion of the
Narraganset country by the English which had been made,
put an end to hostilities for a period in the eastern part of
Connecticut.</p>

<p>In continuing the Narraganset history, <i>Ninigret</i> now
properly comes into view. As already mentioned, he was
sachem of the Nianticks, a tribe of the Narragansets. In
1644, the Narragansets and Ninigret's men united against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
the Mohegans, and for some time obliged Uncas to confine
himself and men to his fort. The Indians, however, afraid
of the English, abandoned the siege, and came in to Boston
to sue for peace. This was granted; but a short time after,
it became necessary to again terrify them. With twenty
men, Captain Atherton marched to the wigwam of Ninigret,
entering which, he seized the chief, and threatened his life.
This step had the desired effect. The Indians begged for
life, and promised submission.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

   <p class="caption2">Captain Atherton in the Wigwam of Ninigret.</p>
</div>

<p>Some time after this occurrence, Ninigret again grew
troublesome, and again had to be quieted by an armed
force sent against him. In the panic with which he was
affected, he submitted to the demands that were laid upon
him. Ninigret passed the winter of 1652-53 among the
Dutch of New York. This circumstance awakened the
suspicions of the English, especially as hostile feelings
existed at that time between the Dutch and English. The
report from several sagamores was, that the Dutch governor
had attempted to hire them to cut off the English. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
consequence was, a special meeting of the English commissioners
of the several New England colonies, to consult in
reference to this subject. Their object was to ascertain
the truth of the rumor, that the Narragansets had leagued
with the Dutch, to break up the English settlements.
Several of the chiefs of the Narragansets were accordingly
questioned by a letter, through an agent living at the Narraganset,
in regard to this plot; but their answers were
altogether exculpatory. As to any positive testimony that
Ninigret was plotting against the English, there appears to

<p>In the year 1652, a war having commenced between
England and Holland, it was apprehended that hostilities
would take place between the colonies of the two nations
in America. A threatening attitude was indeed held for
some time by the Dutch of New Netherlands, and forces
were raised by the four New England colonies; but no collision
occurred. In the event of hostilities, it was believed
that the sachem, Ninigret, would lead the Narragansets to
the aid of the Dutch, and that he had held a conference
with them at Manhattan, in the winter of 1652. Whether
that was the case or not, he refused for some time after to
treat with the English for a continuance of the peace.
Under these threatening appearances, the commissioners of
the colonies met, and resolved to raise two hundred and
seventy infantry, and forty cavalry, for the purpose of
chastising Ninigret's haughtiness, and bringing the Narragansets
to terms. The forces were duly apportioned
among the colonies. Massachusetts had been at first
reluctant, but finally assented to the measure. The commissioners
nominated Major Gibbons, Major Denison, or
Captain Atherton, to the chief command; leaving it, in complaisance,
to the general court of Massachusetts to appoint
which one of the three they should please. But, rejecting
these, who were men of known courage and enterprise,
they appointed Major Simon Willard. The commissioners
instructed him to proceed, with such troops as should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
found at the place of general rendezvous, by the 13th of
October, directly to Ninigret's quarters, and demand of him
the Pequods who had been put under him, and the tribute
which was due. If Ninigret should not deliver them, and
pay the tribute, he was required to take them by force.
He was instructed to demand of the sachem a cessation
from all further hostilities against the Long Island Indians.
Receiving these and some other instructions, he proceeded
into the Narraganset country. When he arrived at the
place of rendezvous, he found that Ninigret had fled into
a swamp about fifteen miles distant. The latter had left
his country, corn, and wigwams, without defence, and they
might have been laid waste without danger or loss. He,
however, returned without ever advancing from his head-quarters,
or doing the enemy the least damage. About a
hundred Pequods took this opportunity to renounce the
government of Ninigret, and come off with the English
army, putting themselves under the control of the whites.</p>

<p>The commissioners in favor of the expedition, were dissatisfied
with the conduct of Major Willard, and charged
him with having neglected a fair opportunity of chastising
the Indians, by the destruction of their dwellings, and their
fields of corn. He, however, pleaded in excuse, that his
instructions were equivocal, and the season for marching
unfavorable. By many people in Connecticut and New
Haven, it was believed that the commander was secretly
instructed by the government of Massachusetts to avoid
depredations on the property of the Indians, and thereby
prevent a war, which the latter colony considered to be of
doubtful policy. However this may be, it is certain that
Major Willard received no censure from the Massachusetts
court, and no one doubted his firmness as an officer.</p>

<p>After the return of the English troops from the Narraganset
country, Ninigret assumed his former spirit of
defiance, and continued the war against the Indians upon
Long Island. Both the Indians and the English there were
soon thrown into great distress. It became apparent that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
these Indians could not hold out much longer, but that they
must submit themselves and their country to the Narragansets,
unless they should receive speedy aid. In consequence
of this state of things, and as these Indians were in alliance
with the colonies, measures were taken to aid them against
Ninigret. An armed vessel was stationed off Montauk to
watch his movements, and forces were held in readiness at
Saybrook and New London, to move on the shortest notice,
should the hostile chief again attempt to invade the island.
Hostilities, however, continued some time, and the tribes in
various directions exhibited a strange, changeable conduct.
Uncas, in this exigency, was so pressed by the Narragansets,
that Connecticut was obliged to send men to his fortress to
assist in defending himself against them. The Narragansets,
in several instances, threatened and plundered the
inhabitants of Connecticut.</p>

<p>In 1657, some mischief was done at Farmington, in which
the Norwootuck and Pocomotuck Indians were supposed to
be accomplices. Even the Mohegans under Uncas also partook
of the hostile spirit, and an assault was made by them
upon the Podunk Indians at Windsor. At length the Long
Island Indians turned against their friends on the island, and
Major Mason was ordered with a force for the protection
of the English in that quarter. At last the war, and the
difficulties in regard to the Narragansets, having ceased for
a period, the English were once more left to pursue the
arts of peace, and consummate their labors for colonizing
the country.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Territory of the Pequods</span>&mdash;Their Character&mdash;Sassacus&mdash;His hatred of the
English&mdash;Cruelties practised towards them&mdash;War declared by Connecticut&mdash;Expedition
of Captain Mason&mdash;Surprise and destruction of the fort&mdash;Further
prosecution of the war&mdash;Happy consequences resulting from it.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Pequods are supposed to have emigrated from the
interior parts of the country, towards the sea-shore of Connecticut.
They inhabited more or less of the territory
now constituting that state, as well as a part of Rhode
Island, and New York as far west as the Hudson river.
At what time this emigration took place, is not known.
Being a fierce, cruel, and warlike people, they made all the
other tribes stand in awe of them, though they were fewer
in number than their neighbors, the Narragansets. The
principal seat of the Pequod sagamores was near the mouth
of the Pequod river, now the Thames, where New London
is built. There was said to be one principal sagamore,
or sachem, over the rest. He who sustained this distinction,
at the time of the English settlements in Connecticut,
was Sassacus. His name alone was a terror to all the
neighboring tribes of Indians. At the height of his power,
he had twenty sachems under him.</p>

<p>Sassacus ever regarded the English with feelings of jealousy
and hatred. As he considered them, intruders on his
domains, he was determined to expel them, if possible.
Fired with rage, he breathed nothing but war and revenge.
The utmost effort and art were employed by him to produce
a combination of Indian power against them. The
Narragansets, as related in another place, barely escaped
the snare. But though unable to effect any extensive
union, Sassacus was firm in himself, and inspired all the
Indians under his influence with the resentment that burned
in his own bosom.</p>

<p>Finding war with this powerful and exasperated chief
unavoidable, the Connecticut people prepared for it with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
such means and resources as they could command. A
court was summoned to meet at Hartford on the 1st day of
May, 1637, at which it was resolved, that an offensive war
should be immediately commenced against the Pequods.
Ninety men were ordered to be raised from the three
towns on Connecticut river, and Captain John Mason was
appointed to command an expedition into the heart of the
Pequod country. At the same time, the report of the
slaughter and horrid cruelties, committed by this savage
tribe against the people of Connecticut, roused the other
colonies to exertions against the common enemy. Massachusetts
resolved to send two hundred men, and Plymouth
forty, to assist the sister-colony in prosecuting the war.
Captains Stoughton, Trask, and Patrick, were appointed
their commanders.</p>

<p>The troops embarked at Hartford on the 10th of May,
and sailed down the river to Saybrook. They consisted
of ninety Englishmen, and about seventy Mohegans and
river Indians. While at Saybrook, forty of the Indians
under Mason, being out at some distance from the place,
fell in with about forty of the enemy, killed seven and captured
one, who was brought to the fort, and executed by
the English. Here the little army was joined by Captain
Underhill with nineteen men, who had some months before
been sent by the governor of Massachusetts to strengthen
the garrison at Saybrook. This accession to his forces
permitted Mason to send back twenty of his original number
for the protection of the infant settlements on the river,
which were peculiarly exposed at this crisis. The whole
force, including the Indians, was embodied and directed by
Mason. After remaining several days at Saybrook to
complete his arrangements, he sailed, with his Connecticut
forces, for Narraganset bay, where he arrived on the 19th
of May. At this place, two hundred of Miantonimoh's
warriors were engaged to accompany the English forces
on the expedition. Information was now received from
Captain Patrick, that he had arrived at Providence with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
forty Massachusetts' men, under orders to join the troops
of Connecticut. For various reasons, but chiefly from an
apprehension that the Pequods might gain intelligence of
the expedition, Mason commenced his march, without
waiting for Patrick's company, and soon reached Nehantick,
the seat of the Narraganset sachems. Here he was
joined by an additional company of Indians&mdash;the whole
army, including the English, amounting to more than five
hundred.</p>

<p>Here they staid over night, and learning that the Pequods
held two forts, one at Mystic river and the other about
three miles west of that, they resolved, contrary to their
original plan of attacking both together, to make a united
attack on the Mystic fort, and accordingly commenced
their march. After a march of twelve miles, through forests
and over hills and morasses, Mason reached the Pawcatuck.
The day was very hot, and the men, through the
great heat and a scarcity of provisions, began to faint.
Here he halted for some time, and refreshed the troops.
In the meanwhile, the Indians, who had previously boasted
how they would fight, when they learned that the forts
were to be actually attacked, and the dreaded Sassacus to
be met, were overcome by their fears, and many of them
returned home to Narraganset. But the intrepid Mason,
resolving to advance, despatched a faithful Indian to reconnoitre
the fort, who soon returned with information that the
Pequods were unapprised of their danger, and appeared to
be resting in entire security. The march was immediately
rëcommenced towards Mystic river, and on the night of
the 26th, the whole body encamped about three miles from
the fort.</p>

<p>"The important crisis was now come when the very
existence of Connecticut, under Providence, was to be
determined by the sword in a single action, by the good
conduct of less than eighty men." They proved themselves,
as the event shows, worthy of the occasion, and
properly conscious of the interest at stake. To God they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
looked for aid and courage, at an hour when the decision
was to be made, whether all that they held dear in life
should be secured, or wrenched from them for ever.</p>

   <p class="caption2">Captain Mason and his Party attacking the Pequod Fort in the Swamp.</p>
</div>

<p>Two hours before day, the troops were in motion for the
assault. At this juncture, Mason's Indians entirely lost
their resolution, and began to fall back. The captain bid
them not to fly, but to surround the fort at any distance
they pleased, and there remain witnesses of the courage of
the English. Without delay, the fort was approached on
two opposite sides, the Pequods having just before been
aroused from sleep by the cry of one of their number,
"Owanux, Owanux!"&mdash;Englishmen, Englishmen! He had,
at that instant, been awakened by the barking of a dog.
While the Pequods were rallying, Mason's troops advanced,
and poured in a fire through the openings of the palisades,
and wheeling off to a side barricaded only with brush,
rushed into the fort, sword in hand. Notwithstanding the
suddenness of the attack, and their great confusion, the
enemy made a desperate resistance. Concealing themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
in and behind their wigwams, they maintained their
ground stoutly against the English, who, advancing in different
directions, cut down every Indian they met. But the
victory was not certain&mdash;it had not been achieved. Mason
felt it to be an awful moment. Happily it occurred to him
to burn the Indian wigwams. The shout was immediately
uttered, "We must burn them!" It was done. In a few
moments the mats, with which their dwellings were covered,
were in a blaze, and the flames spread in every direction.
As the fire increased, the English retired without
the fort, and environed it on every side. The Indians now
recovering courage, formed another circle exterior to that
of the English.</p>

<p>The amazed Pequods, driven from their covert by fire,
climbed the palisades, and presenting themselves in full
view, more than one hundred were shot down. Others,
sallying forth from their burning cells, were shot, or cut in
pieces with the sword. In the mean time, many perished in
the flames within the fort. The battle, in this locality, continued
about an hour, and the scene of terror and blood is
hardly to be described. Seventy wigwams were consumed,
and between five and six hundred of the enemy, of
all descriptions, strewed the ground, or were involved in
the burning pile. This victory was achieved with the loss
only of two men killed and twenty wounded.</p>

<p>In the course of the attack, in the interior of the fort,
Captain Mason's life was in immediate danger. As he was
entering a wigwam to procure a firebrand, a Pequod, perceiving
him, drew his arrow to the head, with a view to
pierce the captain's body. At this critical moment, a resolute
sergeant entering in, rescued his commander from
imminent peril by cutting the bow-string with his cutlass.</p>

<p>Although the result of the engagement was the complete
overthrow of the Pequod camp, yet the situation of the
Connecticut army was extremely dangerous and distressing.
Two of their troops were killed, and at least one-fourth
wounded; the remainder were faint with fatigue and want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
of food; they were in the midst of an enemy's country,
many miles from their vessels, and their ammunition was
nearly expended. The principal fortress of their enemy
was but three miles distant, where there was a fresh army,
which they knew would be filled with rage, on learning the
fate of their comrades. In this perilous condition, while
they were consulting on the course to be pursued, their
vessels, as if guided by the visible hand of Providence,
appeared in sight, steering with a fair wind into the harbor.
The little band, however, were not permitted to reach
Pequod harbor without additional fighting. For no sooner
had the vessels been discovered, than three hundred
Indians came from the other fort, and were disposed to
attack Captain Mason's party. He, however, so disposed
of his few available men, assisted by the Indians with him,
who carried the wounded English, that the Pequods were
prevented from coming so near as to do any mischief. But
the balls of the English muskets took effect on several of
their number; and though, when the enemy came in sight
of the demolished fort, they raved, and tore their hair from
their heads, and rushed forward with the utmost fury to
demolish the English, they were taught to repent their
rashness. Finding all attempts in vain, to break in upon
the little army, they left the victors to pursue the remainder
of their way to Pequod harbor unmolested. They entered
it with their colors flying, and were received on board the
vessels with every demonstration of joy and gratitude.</p>

<p>The troops employed on this expedition, reached their
homes in about three weeks from the time they embarked
at Hartford. They were received with the greatest exultation.
Benisons were poured forth on them from all lips.
But to God, especially, as the helper of his people in their
fearful trial, did the anthem of praise ascend from the
domestic altar and the solemn assembly.</p>

<p>The Pequods, on the departure of Captain Mason, burned
their wigwams, destroyed their principal fort, and were
with difficulty restrained from putting their own chief, Sassacus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
to death, as they looked upon him as the author of
their calamity. They scattered themselves throughout the
country, Sassacus, Mononotto, and seventy or eighty of
their chief counsellors and warriors, taking their route over
Hudson river. In the mean time, Massachusetts, hearing
of the success of Mason, despatched a body of one hundred
and twenty men under Captain Stoughton, to follow
up the victory. Arriving in the enemy's country, the Massachusetts
army, finding a body of that tribe in a swamp,
made an assault upon them, with the aid of the Narragansets.
Some twenty-eight were killed and a larger number
taken prisoners.</p>

<p>The court at Connecticut ordered that forty men should
be raised forthwith, for the further prosecution of the war,
under the same commander. These troops formed a junction
with the party under command of Stoughton at Pequod,
and the conclusion was immediately to march in pursuit of
Sassacus. They proceeded on their way as far as Quinnipiac
(New Haven), where, after staying several days,
they received intelligence that the enemy was at a considerable
distance, in a great swamp to the westward. Here
the Indians were met, and an engagement took place,
under circumstances of great difficulty to the English,
many of whom were nearly mired, but it was nevertheless
attended with success. The fighting was of a most desperate
character, the assailants finding it nearly impossible
to master or dislodge the foe. Under the cover of a fog,
after having been watched through the night, Sassacus and
sixty or seventy of his bravest warriors broke through the
English ranks, and escaped. About twenty Indians were
killed, and one hundred and eighty were taken prisoners.
The Pequods, who remained in the territory, amounting to
some two hundred, besides women and children, were at
length divided among the Narragansets and Mohegans,
and the nation became extinct.</p>

<p>The character of this war, from the boldness and vigor
with which it had been prosecuted, seemed to belong to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
age of romance. It is replete with thrilling incident and
daring adventure. Yet the sober, religious spirit and convictions
of duty, which accompanied the pilgrims to battle,
turn its chivalrous aspect into the features of stern reality
and unavoidable necessity. It involved the fate of an infant
republic and the interests of posterity. The conquest of
the Pequods, while it was so fatal to one party, was productive
of the most happy consequences to the other. It
struck the Indians throughout New England with such a
salutary terror, that they were contented to remain at peace
nearly forty years.</p>

<p>To communities and nations, crises arrive, in which,
through danger and sufferings, they are either overcome and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
extirpated, or spring forward to an improved condition after
the first hurtful effect of the trial is passed away. The war
with Philip constituted such a crisis to the New England
colonies. Their danger was imminent&mdash;their sufferings
were fearful, and the immediate consequences were lamentation,
and weakness, and indebtedness. But their recuperative
energies soon rëappeared, and a wide door thus
became open to extended settlement and population.</p>

<p>The causes of the war lay partly in the condition of
the colonies, and partly in the character of Philip. The
English settlements were extending far into the wilderness,
the home of the Indian, and were rapidly increasing in
strength. The natives viewed them as intruders, and considered
the probability that, at no distant day, they would
be dispossessed of the heritage of their fathers. They
were jealous of the designs of the English, and impatient
under the encroachments already made. They viewed
themselves as the proper lords of the forest, and they now
saw that their hunting grounds were abridged, and the
wild animals on which they depended for subsistence, were
disappearing, as the white man felled the trees, and cultivated
the soil, and reared his dwellings.</p>

<p>In view of this progress of the whites, nothing seemed
to remain to the native savage but to be forced from his
loved haunts, and to lose his cherished possessions, or to
arouse, and by a desperate effort of strength and valor to
regain all that he once owned.</p>

<p>The individual among the Indians whose foresight most
clearly discerned the state of things, and whose spirit was
equal to the emergency of attempting to resist it, was
<i>Pometacom.</i> He was styled <i>Philip</i> by the English, a nickname
given him on account of his ambitious and haughty
temper, and by this name he is chiefly known in history.
He was the sachem of the Wampanoags, residing at Mount
Hope, a younger son of the famous Massasoit, the friend
of the whites.</p>

<p>Philip had not spared any pains for a long time to effect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
a conspiracy, and to unite the Indians in a general war
against the colonists; but it happened that before his plan
was matured, his intentions, and those of the Indians generally,
were revealed to the English. The Indian who
betrayed him was Sausaman, one of Eliot's converts. For
this he was murdered by Philip's men; three of whom were
seized, tried, and executed. This was the signal for blood.
The first attack of the Indians was upon Swansey, several
of whose inhabitants were killed.</p>

   <p class="caption2">Flight of Philip from Mount Hope.</p>
</div>

<p>Philip soon after suddenly left his place of residence and
his territory to the English. The occasion of his precipitate
retreat, was the following: Additional assistance being
needed, the authorities of Boston sent out Major General
Savage from that place, with sixty horse and as many foot.
They scoured the country on the march to Mount Hope,
where Philip and his wife were supposed to be at that time.
They came into his neighborhood unawares, so that he was
forced to rise from dinner, and he and all with him fled farther
up into the country. They pursued him as far as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
could go for swamps; and killed fifteen or sixteen in that
expedition.</p>

   <p class="caption2">Captain Church and his men hemmed in by Indians.</p>
</div>

<p>At the solicitation of Benjamin Church, a company of
thirty-six men were put under him and Captain Fuller, who
on the 8th of July marched down into Pocasset Neck. This
force, small as it was, afterwards divided&mdash;Church taking
nineteen men, and Fuller the remaining seventeen. The
party under Church proceeded into a point of land called
Punkateeset, now the southerly extremity of Tiverton, where
they were attacked by a body of three hundred Indians.
After a few moments' fight, the English retreated to the
sea-shore, and thus saved themselves from destruction; for
Church perceived that it was the intention of the Indians
to surround them. They could expect little more than to
perish, but they knew they were in a situation to sell their
lives at the dearest rate. Thus hemmed in, Church had a
double duty to perform&mdash;that of preserving the spirit of his
followers, several of whom viewed their situation as desperate,
and erecting piles of stone to defend them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>As boats had been appointed to attend upon the English
in this expedition, the heroic party looked for relief from
this quarter; but though the boats appeared, they were kept
off by the fire of the Indians, and Church, in a moment of
vexation, bid them be gone. The Indians, now encouraged,
fired thicker and faster than before. The situation of the
English was now most forlorn, although as yet, providentially,
not one of them had been wounded. Night was
coming on, their ammunition nearly spent, and the Indians
had possessed themselves of a stone house that overlooked
them; but, just in season to save them, a sloop was discovered
bearing down towards the shore. It was commanded
by a resolute man, Captain Golding, who effected the embarkation
of the company, taking only two at a time in a
canoe. During all this time, the Indians plied their fire-arms;
and Church, who was the last to embark, narrowly
escaped the balls of the enemy, one grazing the hair of his
head, and another lodging in a stake, which happened to
stand just before the centre of his breast. The band under
Captain Fuller met with a similar fortune, but escaped by
getting possession of an old house, close upon the water's
edge, and were early taken off by boats. He had two of
his party wounded.</p>

<p>Church soon after joined a body of English forces, and
again penetrated Pocasset, and renewed his skirmishes with
the enemy. The main body of the English, not long after,
arrived at the place; on which, Philip retired into the
recesses of a large swamp. Here his situation, for a time,
was exceedingly critical; but at length he contrived to
elude his besiegers; and, effecting his escape, fled to the
Nipmucks, by whom he was readily received.</p>

<p>Soon after the war began, an effort had been made by
the governor of Massachusetts to dissuade the Nipmucks
from espousing the cause of Philip. But at the time, not
agreeing among themselves, they would only consent to
meet the English commissioners at a place three miles from
Brookfield on a specified day. The English authorities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
deputed Captains Hutchinson and Wheeler to proceed to
the appointed place. They took with them twenty mounted
men, and three Christian Indians as guides and interpreters.
On reaching the place agreed upon, no Indians were to be
seen; upon this, the party proceeded still further; when,
on reaching a narrow defile, they were suddenly attacked.
Eight men were killed outright, and three mortally wounded;
among the latter, was Captain Hutchinson. With the above
loss, a retreat was effected; and, under the guidance of the
three Christian Indians, the remnant made their way to
Brookfield.</p>

</div>

<p>They were, however, immediately followed by the Indian
foe. Luckily, there was barely time to alarm the inhabitants,
who, to the number of seventy or eighty, flocked into
a garrison-house. It was slightly fortified about the exterior
side, by a few logs hastily thrown up, and in the interior
by a few feather beds suspended to deaden the force of the
bullets. The house was soon surrounded by the enemy,
and shot poured upon it in all directions. But the fire of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
the besieged kept the Indians from a very near approach.
By persevering exertions, the English were enabled to
maintain themselves, until a force under Major Willard
came to their relief. He was in the vicinity of Lancaster
with forty-eight dragoons, when he learned the critical
condition of Brookfield. With a forced march of thirty
miles, he reached the place the following night.</p>

<p>At the very time Major Willard arrived at Brookfield,
the Indians were contriving some machinery to set the
garrison on fire. They first endeavored to effect their purpose
by fire-arrows, and rags dipped in brimstone tied to
long poles spliced together. But this method was without
effect, while it exposed them to the deadly fire of those
within the building. They next filled a cart with hemp,
flax, and other combustible materials; and this, after they
set it on fire, they thrust backward with their long poles.
But no sooner had the flame began to take effect, than it
was extinguished by an unexpected shower of rain.</p>

<p>Major Willard soon left the region of Brookfield, and
marched the principal part of his forces to Hadley, for the
protection of the settlements in that quarter. When he
had completed his business, he returned to Boston, leaving
Lathrop and Beers at Hadley. A considerable number of
christianized Indians, belonging to the neighborhood of
Hadley, occupied a small fort about a mile above Hatfield.
On the occurrence of the difficulties in that region, these,
as all other Indians, were watched and suspected of conniving
with Philip. To put their fidelity to a test, Captains
Lathrop and Beers, with a force of one hundred and eighty
men, ordered these Indians to surrender their arms. They
hesitated to do so then, but promised a speedy compliance.
Yet, on the following night, August 25th, they left their fort,
and fled up the river towards Deerfield to join Philip. The
English captains commenced a pursuit early the next morning,
and came up with them at a swamp, opposite to the
present town of Sunderland, where a warm contest ensued.
The Indians fought bravely, but were finally routed, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
loss of twenty-six of their number. The whites lost ten
men. The Indians, who escaped, joined Philip's forces, and
Lathrop and Beers returned to their station in Hadley.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="illus-171.jpg" id="illus-171.jpg"></a>
   <img src="images/illus-171.jpg" alt="Battle of Muddy Brook." title="Battle of Muddy Brook."/>
   <p class="caption2">Battle of Muddy Brook.</p>
</div>

<p>Near the middle of September, Captain Lathrop was
sent from Hadley, with eighty-eight men, to bring away
some corn, grain, and other valuable articles from Deerfield.
It was at that very time that the company under Captain
Mosely, then quartered at Deerfield, intended to pursue the
enemy. But upon the 10th of the month, "that most fatal
day, the saddest that ever befel New England," Lathrop's
company was attacked by the Indians, who had selected a
place very advantageous to their purpose, knowing that the
English with their teams would pass the road at the spot.
The place was at the village now called Muddy Brook, in
the southerly part of Deerfield, where the road crossed a
small stream (as it now does), bordered by a narrow
morass. Here the Indians, in great force, had planted
themselves in ambuscade; and no sooner had Lathrop
arrived at the spot, than the Indians poured a heavy and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
destructive fire upon the columns, and then rushed furiously
to close engagement. The English ranks were broken,
and the scattered troops were every where attacked.
Those who survived, after the first onset, met the foe individually,
and endeavored to sell their lives as dearly as
possible. Seeking the covert of a tree, each one selected
an object of attack, and the awful conflict now became a
trial of skill in sharp shooting, on the issues of which life
or death was suspended. But the overwhelming superiority
of the Indians, as to numbers, left no room for hope
on the part of the English. They were cut down every
instant from behind their retreats, until nearly the whole
number were destroyed. The dead, the dying, the wounded,
strewed the ground in every direction. Out of nearly one
hundred, including the teamsters, only seven or eight
escaped from the bloody spot. The wounded were indiscriminately
massacred. This company consisted of choice
young men, "the very flower of Essex county, none of
whom were ashamed to speak with the enemy in the gate."
Eighteen of the men belonged to Deerfield.</p>

<p>Captain Mosely, being only four or five miles distant,
heard the sound of musketry, and reasonably concluded
what was the cause of the report. By a rapid march for
the relief of Lathrop, he arrived at the close of the struggle,
when he found the Indians stripping and mangling the
dead. At once he rushed on in compact order, and broke
through the enemy, charging back and forth, and cutting
down all within range of his shot. After several hours of
gallant fighting, he compelled the Indians to flee into the
more distant parts of the forest. His loss amounted to two
killed and eleven wounded.</p>

<p>Until this period, the Indians near Springfield remained
friendly, and refused the appeals of Philip, to cöoperate
with him against the white population. But now that he
held the northern towns, they were closely watched by the
English, who supposed that the Indians might take sides
with him, as his cause seemed likely to prevail. The suspicions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
entertained concerning them were confirmed. On
the night of the 4th of October, they admitted about three
hundred of Philip's men into their fort, which was situated
at a place called Longhill, about a mile below the village
of Springfield, and a plan was concerted for the destruction
of the place. The plot, however, was revealed by an
Indian at Windsor, and the inhabitants of Springfield had
time barely to escape into their garrisons. Here they
resisted the attacks of the Indians until they received relief
from abroad. The unfortified houses, thirty-two in number,
together with twenty-five barns, were burned by the
savages. The people were reduced to great distress,
and had very inadequate means of support through the
ensuing winter.</p>

<p>The confidence of Philip and his Indians was now
greatly increased by their successes. The next blow
which they aimed, was at the head-quarters of the whites,
hoping to destroy Hatfield, Hadley, and Northampton, as
they had Springfield. But by the providence of God, and
the good conduct of the whites, they were effectually
foiled. At this time, Captain Appleton, with one company,
lay at Hadley, and Captains Mosely and Poole, with two
companies, at Hatfield, and Major Treat was just returned
to Northampton for the security of that settlement. Against
such commanders, it was in vain for the untutored Indian to
contend in regular battle. Philip's men, however, made a
bold attempt, and seven or eight hundred strong fell upon
Hatfield, on the 19th of October, attacking it on all sides at
once. They had previously cut off several parties, which
were scouring the woods in the vicinity. While Poole
bravely defended one extremity, Mosely, with no less vigor,
protected the centre, and Appleton, coming on with his
troops, maintained the other extremity. After a severe
struggle, the Indians were repulsed at every point.</p>

<p>After leaving the western frontier of Massachusetts,
Philip was known next to be in the country of his allies,
the Narragansets. They had not heartily engaged in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
war; but their inclination to do so was not doubted, and it
was the design of Philip to incite them to activity. An
army of fifteen hundred English was therefore raised by
the three colonies of Massachusetts, Plymouth, and Connecticut,
for the purpose of breaking down the power of
Philip among the Narragansets. It was believed that the
next spring, that nation would come with all their power
upon the whites. Conanchet, their sachem, in violation of
the treaty, had not only received Philip's warriors, but
aided their operations against the English. These were
the grounds of the great expedition against the Narragansets,
in the winter of 1675.</p>

<p>Philip had strongly fortified himself in South Kingston,
Rhode Island, on an elevated portion of an immense
swamp. Here his men had erected about five hundred
wigwams, of a superior construction, in which was deposited
an abundant store of provisions. Baskets and tubs of
corn (hollow trees cut off about the length of a barrel),
were piled one upon another, about the inside of the dwellings,
which rendered them bullet-proof. Here about three
thousand persons, as is supposed, had taken up their residence
for the winter, among whom were Philip's best
warriors.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

   <img src="images/illus-175.jpg" alt="THE SWAMP FIGHT." title="THE SWAMP FIGHT."/>
   <p class="caption2">THE SWAMP FIGHT.</p>
</div>

<p>The forces destined to the attack of this great rendezvous
of Philip and his men, were under command of Governor
Winslow, of Plymouth. By reasons of a great body
of snow, and the prevalence of intense cold, much time
was consumed in reaching the fort. On the 19th of December,
they arrived before it; and, by reason of a want of
provisions, found an immediate attack indispensable. No
Englishman, however, was acquainted with its situation,
and, but for an Indian, who betrayed his countrymen, there
is little probability that the assailants could have effected
any thing against it. The hour of their arrival was one
o'clock on that short day of the year. There was but one
point where the place could be assailed with the least probability
of success, and this was fortified by a kind of blockhouse,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a><br /><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
directly in front of the entrance, and had also flankers
to cover a cross-fire. The place was protected by high
palisades, and an immense hedge of fallen trees surrounding
it on all sides. Between the fort and the main land was a
body of water, which could be crossed only on a large tree
lying over it. Such was the formidable aspect of the place&mdash;such
the difficulty of gaining access to the interior of it.</p>

<p>On coming to the spot, the English soldiers, attempting
to pass upon the tree in single file, the only possible mode,
were instantly swept off by the fire of the enemy. Still,
others, led by their captains, supplied the places of the slain.
These also met the same fearful fire, with the same fatal
effect. The attempts were repeated, until six captains and
a large number of men had fallen. And now was a partial,
but momentary, recoil from the face of death.</p>

<p>At length, however, Captain Mosely got within the fort,
with a small band of men. Then commenced a terrible
struggle, at fearful odds. While these were contending
hand to hand with the Indians, the cry was heard, "They
run! they run!" and immediately a considerable body of
their fellow-soldiers rushed in. The slaughter of the foe
became immense, as the assailants were insufficient in
strength to drive them from the main breast-work. Captain
Church, who was acting as aid to Winslow, at the
head of a volunteer party, about this time dashed through
the fort, and reached the swamp in the rear, where he
poured a destructive fire on the rear of a party of the
enemy. Thus attacked in different directions, the warriors
were at length compelled to relinquish their ground, and
flee into the wilderness.</p>

<p>The Indian cabins, (contrary to the advice of some of the
officers, who thought it best that the wearied and wounded
soldiers should rest there for a time,) "were now set on fire;
in a few moments every thing in the interior of the fort
was involved in a blaze; and a scene of horror was now
exhibited. Several hundred of the Indians strewed the
ground on all sides: about three hundred miserable women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
and children with lamentable shrieks were running in every
direction to escape the flames, in which many of the wounded,
as well as the helpless old men, were seen broiling and roasting,
and adding to the terrors of the scene by their agonizing
yells. The most callous heart must have been melted to
pity at so awful a spectacle. By information afterwards
obtained from a Narraganset chief, it was ascertained that
they lost about seven hundred warriors at the fort, and
three hundred who died of their wounds. After the
destruction of the place, Winslow, about sunset, commenced
his march for Pettyquamscott, in a snow storm, carrying
most of his dead and wounded, where he arrived a little
after midnight. Several wounded, probably not mortally,
were overcome with cold, and died on their march; and
the next day thirty-four were buried in one grave. Many
were severely frozen, and about four hundred so disabled
that they were unfit for duty. The whole number killed
and wounded, was about two hundred." The sufferings
of the English, after the fight, were well pronounced to be
almost without a parallel in history.</p>

<p>The spirit of Philip animated the Indians even where he
was not present, for he was now by some supposed to be
beyond the frontier. On the 19th of February, they surprised
Lancaster with complete success, falling upon it with
a force of several hundred warriors. It contained at that
time fifty families, of whom forty-two persons were killed
and captured. Most of the buildings were set on fire.
Among the captives were Mrs. Rowlandson and her
children, the family of the minister of that place, who
were afterwards happily redeemed. The town was saved
from entire ruin by the arrival of Captain Wadsworth with
forty men from Marlborough.</p>

<p>Not far from this time a fatal affair occurred at Pawtuxet
river, in Rhode Island. Captain Pierce, of Scituate, with
fifty men, and twenty Cape Cod Indians, having passed
the river, unexpectedly met with a large body of Indians.
Perceiving that their numbers rendered an attack upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
them hopeless, he fell back, and took a position so as to be
sheltered by the bank. In this situation, the company was
not long secure. Part of the Indians crossed the river, and
attacked them from the opposite bank, while the remainder
encircled them on the side of the river, where they had
sought protection, and poured in upon them a most destructive
fire. Hemmed in so effectually, there was no possibility
of escape, and nothing was left them but to sell their lives
as dearly as possible. This was accordingly done, and
before the unfortunate men were nearly all cut off, more
than a hundred of the enemy are said to have fallen by the
desperate valor of the English.</p>

<p>The Christian Cape Cod Indians showed their faithfulness
and courage in this melancholy affair, as also their
dexterity and foresight. Four of them effected their
escape, and one of these aided the escape of the only
Englishman that survived the encounter. One of them,
whose name was Amos, after Captain Pierce was disabled
by a wound, would not leave him, so long as there was a
prospect of rendering him service, but loaded and fired his
piece several times. At length, to save himself, he adroitly
adopted the plan of painting his face black, as he perceived
the enemy had done to their faces. In this disguise he ran
among them, and pretended to join them in the fight; but
watching his opportunity, he soon escaped into the woods.
Of another it is reported, that being pursued by one of the
enemy, he sought the shelter of a large rock. While in
that situation, he perceived that his foe lay ready with his
gun on the opposite side, to fire upon him as soon as he
stirred. A stratagem only saved his life. Raising carefully
his hat upon a pole, he seemed to the person lying in wait,
to have exposed himself to a shot. A ball was instantly
sent through the hat, but one was returned in earnest
against the head of the enemy. Thus the Christian Indian,
through his address, found the means of escape from his
singular peril. A similar subtle device was used by another
of these Indians, who was pursued as he attempted to cross<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
the river. Hiding himself behind a mass of earth turned
up with the roots of a tree, he was watched by the enemy,
in the expectation that he would soon be obliged to change
his position. But, instead of doing this, the Cape Cod
Indian, perforating his breastwork, made a convenient loophole,
and shot his enemy before he had time to notice the
artifice. The fourth Cape Cod Indian who escaped, effected
his object by affecting to be in pursuit of an Englishman
with his upraised hatchet. This ingenious feint, of course,
was the means of saving the white man at the same time.</p>

</div>

<p>The work of destruction continued among the towns of
New England at this period. To a greater or less extent
Rehoboth and Providence suffered&mdash;also, Plymouth, Chelmsford,
and Andover&mdash;either men were killed, or dwelling-houses
and barns were burned. But the most signal disaster,
at this time, fell upon the English in the vicinity of
Sudbury. On the morning of the 20th of April, the largest
body of Indians which had at any time appeared, attacked
the place, and, before a force could be brought against them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
set fire to several buildings, which were consumed. The
inhabitants rallied, and bravely defended their homes; and,
being soon joined by some soldiers from Watertown, they
forced the Indians to retreat without effecting further mischief
against the town that day. On hearing the news of
the attack on Sudbury, some of the people of Concord
flew for its protection. As they approached a garrison-house,
a few Indians were discovered, and a pursuit was
given them. The flight of the latter proved to be only a
decoy, and the Concord people, eleven in number, found
themselves ambushed on every side. Fighting with the
utmost desperation, they were all cut off except one. The
Indians, who remained in the adjoining woods for further
depredations, found another opportunity to glut their vengeance
against the whites. Captain Wadsworth, hearing
of the transactions at Sudbury, marched with several men,
joined by Captain Brocklebank and ten others, towards the
place. At a mile and a half from the town, five hundred
Indians lay in ambush behind the hills. When Wadsworth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
arrived at the spot, the Indians sent out a few of their party,
who crossed the track of the English, and, being discovered
by the latter, affected to fly through fear. Wadsworth,
with great want of caution, immediately commenced a
pursuit, and was consequently drawn into the ambush.
The Indians began the attack with great boldness. For
some time, the English maintained good order, and retreated
with small loss to an adjacent hill. After fighting four hours,
and losing many men, the Indians became doubly enraged,
and resolved to try the effect of another stratagem. In
this they completely succeeded. They immediately set the
woods on fire to the windward of the English, which,
owing to the wind, and the dryness of grass and other
combustibles, spread with great and fatal rapidity. The
English were driven, by the fury of the flames, from their
favorable position, and were thus exposed to the tomahawks
of the Indians. Nearly all the English fell&mdash;some
accounts say that they sold their lives, to the last man.</p>

   <p class="caption2">Fight near Sudbury.</p>
</div>

<p>Several towns in the colony of Plymouth, as Scituate,
Bridgewater, Middleborough, and Plymouth, were in turn
attacked and injured, though not many of their inhabitants
were destroyed. They probably betook themselves to
the fortified houses, which now became common in the
exposed villages.</p>

<p>Connecticut, not being exposed to the incursions of the
natives, sent out several volunteer companies in aid of her
sister colonies, in addition to the troops required as her
quota in the present war. These volunteer forces were
raised principally from New London, Norwich, and Stonington,
joined by a body of friendly Indians. On the 27th
of March, a body of these troops, under Captains Dennison
and Avery, penetrated the country of the hostile Narragansets.
In the course of their excursion, they struck the
trail of a large body of Indians, and commenced pursuit.
The latter, upon the approach of the English, scattered in
all directions. It proved to be a force commanded by
Conanchet. He took a route by himself and, being swift<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
of foot, hoped to outstrip his pursuers. In crossing a
river, however, he accidentally plunged under water, and
wet his gun. On this occurrence, he was soon overtaken
by a fast-running Pequod, to whom he surrendered himself
at once. A young Englishman, coming up, began to put
various questions to the chief, who, little liking to be catechised
in that manner, replied to him, with a look of contempt:
"You much child&mdash;no understand matters of war;
let your captain come: him I will answer." Conanchet was
conveyed to Stonington, and, after a sort of trial, was
condemned to be shot by the Mohegan and Pequod
sachems. The alternative of life was, however, presented
to him, if he would make peace with the English. The
chieftain indignantly refused it, and gave utterance to the
feelings of his untamed spirit, when his sentence was pronounced,
in the sentiment, that "he liked it well that he
should die before his heart was soft, or he had said any
thing unworthy of himself." Conanchet was the son of the
famous Miantonimoh, who was put to death by Uncas, as
related in another portion of this work.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>When success no longer attended Philip in Massachusetts,
those of his allies whom he had seduced into this war began
to accuse him as the author of all their calamities. Many
of the tribes, therefore, scattered themselves in different
directions. The Deerfield Indians were among the first
who abandoned his cause, and many of the Nipmucks and
Narragansets soon followed their example. Still, Philip,
though he had not been much seen during the winter&mdash;and
it is doubtful, even, where he had spent the most of it&mdash;had
no intention of abating his efforts against the English. In
the month of May, 1676, he was found at the head of a
powerful force, in the northern part of Massachusetts,
extending many miles on its frontier from east to west.
Considerable numbers of his people were also still in and
about Narraganset, ravaging and annoying the adjacent
English settlements.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>
<p>Large bodies of the Indians, about this time, anxious to
secure the advantages of fishing in Connecticut river, took
up positions at the falls, between the present towns of Gill
and Montague. This was in the vicinity of the line of
country occupied by Philip's forces. They felt the more
secure here, as the English forces at Hadley and the adjacent
towns were not at this time at all numerous. Two
captive lads, who had escaped from the Indians, informed
the English of their situation, and the little pains they had
taken to guard themselves. The intelligence thus brought
induced the people of Hatfield, Hadley, and Northampton,
to raise a force, for the purpose of attacking the enemy at
so favorable a point. About one hundred and sixty troops
were raised, and placed under the command of Captain
Turner. They marched silently in the dead of the night,
and came upon the Indians a little before the dawn of day,
whom they found almost in a dead sleep, and without any
scouts abroad, or watching around their wigwams at home.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

   <img src="images/illus-183.jpg" alt="Indians attacked at Connecticut River Falls." title="Indians attacked at Connecticut River Falls."/>
   <p class="caption2">Indians attacked at Connecticut River Falls.</p>
</div>

<p>When the Indians were first awakened by the thunder of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
their guns, they cried out, "Mohawks! Mohawks!" as if
their own native enemies had been upon them; but the
dawning of the light soon rectified their error, though it
could not prevent their danger. The loss of the Indians
was great: one hundred men were left dead on the ground,
and one hundred and forty were seen to pass down the
cataract, but one of whom escaped drowning.</p>

<p>The march of the English forces back was, however,
attended with no small disaster. The Indians, learning the
inconsiderable numbers that had attacked them, rallied in
their turn, and hung upon the rear of the English. Their
captain, just then enfeebled by sickness, was unable to
arrange or conduct his forces as they should have been;
and the consequence was a degree of confusion, and their
separation into small parties. In this manner, they suffered
the loss of thirty-eight men, though the Indians paid dearly
for it by the loss of more than a hundred of their warriors
on the way. Captain Turner perished in the expedition.</p>

<p>By the destruction at the falls, Philip's forces were seriously
diminished; yet his spirit continued unsubdued and
undaunted, and he was resolved to retort upon the English
the injuries he had sustained. Accordingly, on the 30th of
May, six hundred of his warriors appeared at Hatfield, and
rushed suddenly into the town. They immediately set fire
to twelve unfortified buildings, and attacked several palisaded
dwelling-houses. These were bravely defended by
the people. In the midst of the fight, as the inhabitants
were attacked, whether in their dwellings or at their labors,
a party of twenty-five resolute young men crossed the river
from Hadley, and came with such animation upon the
Indians, and with so deadly a fire, that the latter were
driven back. Eventually, the whole body of the enemy
was obliged to return, without effecting, as was intended,
the complete destruction of the place. They, however,
drove off a large number of sheep and cattle.</p>

<p>Massachusetts and Connecticut now increased their forces
in this quarter, as it appeared that the foe was determined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
on devastating the settlements upon the river. Hadley
became next the object of attack, in which about seven
hundred Indians were engaged. The assault was made on
the 12th of June, the Indians having laid an ambuscade at
the southern extremity, and advanced the main body towards
the other the preceding night. Though the Indians exhibited
their usual fierceness, they were met and repulsed at
the palisades. Renewing their attacks upon other points,
they seemed resolved to carry the place. Still, they were
held in check until assistance arrived from Northampton,
when the foe was driven into the woods.</p>

   <p class="caption2">Defence of Hadley.</p>
</div>

<p>It was during this attack, as is supposed, that the assistance
was afforded to the whites which has generally been
ascribed to Goffe, one of the fugitive judges from England,
which at the time was believed to have been rendered
by the guardian angel of the place. In the midst of the
confusion and distress of the battle, a gray-headed, venerable-looking
man, whose costume differed from that of the
inhabitants, appeared, and assumed the direction of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
defence. He arrayed the people in the best manner,
showing that he well understood military tactics, led in the
battle, and, by his exhortations and efforts, rendered essential
aid on the occasion. After the departure of the Indians, he
was not observed, and nothing was heard of him afterwards.
As it is known that, at that time, Goffe and Whalley were
concealed in the house of Mr. Russel in Hadley, it is
inferred that one of these men, Goffe (for Whalley was
superanuated) left his concealment, in the danger which
existed, and put forth the effort here recorded, in order to
save the town.</p>

<p>Philip was now secure in no place, but his haughty spirit
was untamed by adversity. Although meeting with constant
losses, and among them some of his most experienced
warriors, he, nevertheless, seemed as hostile and determined
as ever. In August, the intrepid Church made a
descent upon his head-quarters, at Matapoiset, where he
killed and took prisoners about one hundred and thirty of
his men. Even Philip escaped with difficulty. So great
was his precipitation, that he was obliged to leave his wampum
behind, which, with his wife and son, fell into the hands
of the victors. That son, it was afterwards ascertained,
was sold into slavery, as it was also the mournful fact, with
a number of Philip's captured followers. Philip, as stated
above, escaped with difficulty. The particulars, as related
by Church, are as follow: Church's guide had brought him
to a place where a large tree, which the enemy had fallen
across a river, lay. Church had come to the top end of
the tree when he happened to spy an Indian upon the
stump of it, on the other side of the stream. He immediately
leveled his gun against the Indian, and had doubtless
despatched him, had not one of his own Indians called
hastily to him not to fire, for he believed it was one of his
own men. Hearing this, in all probability the Indian upon
the stump looked about, and Church's Indian, then seeing
his face, perceived his mistake, for he knew him to be
Philip. Church's Indian then fired himself, but it was too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
late. Philip immediately threw himself off the stump,
leaped down a bank on the other side of the river, and was
out of sight. Church at once gave chase for him, but was
unable to discover his course, and only took some of his
friends and followers, as has been related.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="illus-187.jpg" id="illus-187.jpg"></a>
   <img src="images/illus-187.jpg" alt="Philip's Escape." title="Philip's Escape."/>
   <p class="caption2">Philip's Escape.</p>
</div>

<p>But from this time, Philip was too closely watched and
hotly pursued to escape destruction. His end was rapidly
drawing near, his followers mostly deserted him, and he
was driven from place to place, until he found himself in
his ancient seat near Pokanoket. The immediate occasion
of his death is thus narrated: He having put to death one
of his own men, for advising him to make peace, this man's
brother, whose name was Alderman, fearing the same fate,
deserted him, and gave Captain Church an account of his
situation, and offered to lead him to his camp. Early on
Saturday morning, 12th August, Church came to the swamp
where Philip was encamped, and, before he was discovered,
had placed a guard about it so as to encompass it, except
at a small place. He then ordered Captain Golding to rush<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
into the swamp, and fall upon Philip in his camp, which he
immediately did, but was discovered as he approached,
and, as usual, Philip was the first to fly. Having but just
awaked from sleep, and having put on part of his clothes, he
fled with all his might. Coming directly upon an Englishman
and Indian, who composed a part of the ambush at
the edge of the swamp, the Englishman's gun missed fire,
but Alderman, the Indian, whose gun was loaded with two
balls, sent one through his heart and another not above
two inches from it. "He fell upon his face in the mud and
water, with his gun under him."</p>

   <img src="images/illus-188.jpg" alt="Death of Philip." title="Death of Philip."/>
   <p class="caption2">Death of Philip.</p>
</div>

<p>This important news was immediately communicated to
Captain Church, by the man who performed the exploit;
but the captain suffered nothing to be said concerning it, as
he wished to dislodge the enemy from his retreat. Philip's
great captain, Annawon, had, however, led out about sixty
of his followers from their dangerous situation, and, when
the English scoured the swamp, they found not many
Indians left. These were killed and captured. After the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
affair was over, Church communicated to his troops the
gratifying intelligence of Philip's death, upon which the
whole army gave three loud huzzas. Philip's body was
drawn from the spot where he fell, the head taken off, and
the body left unburied, to be devoured by wild beasts.
With the great chief fell five of his most trusty followers;
one of whom was his chief captain's son, and the Indian
who fired the first gun in this bloody war. Thus fell this
chieftain, who, though an untutored savage, was doubtless
a great man&mdash;considered in reference to his intellectual
resources and the influence he wielded among his compatriots.
Had his lot fallen among a civilized race, and
fighting as he did for his native country, he had been as
illustrious as any hero of any age or clime.</p>

<p>Philip's war proved a most serious concern to the infant
colonies. It cost them half a million of dollars, and the
lives of above six hundred inhabitants, who were either
killed in battle, or otherwise destroyed by the enemy.
Thirteen towns and six hundred houses were burned, and
there was scarcely a family in the United Colonies that had
not occasion to mourn the death of a relative. Dr. Trumbull
thinks the loss exceeds the common estimate. He
concludes that about one fencible man in eleven was killed,
and every eleventh family burned out. But the war was
still more disastrous to the Indians. Great numbers of them
fell in battle; their lodges were destroyed, and, indeed,
their country conquered. Scarcely a hundred warriors
remained of the great leading tribe of the Narragansets.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>Of Philip's warriors, several were remarkable men.&mdash;Among
these were Nanunteno, or Cononchet; Annawon,
Quinnapin, Tuspaquin, and Tatoson. We can briefly notice
but one&mdash;the mighty Annawon. We have seen that at
the time of Philip's death, he escaped with a number of
his men. The place of his retreat was not long after
disclosed by an Indian and his daughter, who had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
captured. It was in a swamp in the south-east part of
Rehoboth. Captain Church, upon this information, adopted
a most daring stratagem to secure Annawon. At the head
of a small party, conducted by his informers, Church
cautiously approached in the evening the edge of a rocky
precipice, under which the chief was encamped, and critically
examined the position. The Indians, their arms, their
employments, (for they were preparing for a meal,) and
other defences, were all noticed by Captain Church; and
particularly the fact, that Annawon and his son were
reposing near the arms. As he learned from his guide that
no one was allowed to go out or come into the camp, except
by the precipice, he determined to seek his object in that
direction. The Indian and his daughter, according to a
concerted plan, with baskets upon their backs, as if bringing
in provisions, preceded Church and his men, by their
shadows concealing the latter, and descended the rock.
In this way, although with great difficulty, they all reached
the bottom without alarming the Indians. It happened,
singularly enough, that their descent was accomplished
without discovery, on account of the noise made by the
pounding of a mortar; a squaw being engaged in that work
in preparing green dried corn for their supper. Under
favor of the noise thus made, the rustling sound proceeding
from their leaps from crag to crag was not noticed. Church,
with his hatchet in his hand, stepped over the young man's
head to the arms. The young Annawon threw his blanket
suddenly over his head, and shrunk up in a heap. The old
chief started upon end, and cried out <i>Howah!</i> meaning
Welcome! Finding that there was no escape, he resigned
himself to his fate, and fell back on his couch; while his
captors secured the rest of the company. English and
Indian amicably ate their supper together, and Church
afterwards laid down to rest, as he had not slept during
the thirty-six previous hours; but his mind was too full of
cares to admit of repose, and after lying a short time, he
got up. On one occasion, during the night, he felt suspicious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
of Annawon's intentions, as the latter, after attempting
in vain to sleep, arose, and left the spot a short time.
Returning with something in his hands, (Church having in
the mean time prepared himself for the worst,) he placed it
on the ground, and, falling on his knees before his captor,
said: "Great Captain, you have killed Philip and conquered
his country, for I believe that I and my company are the last
that war against the English. I suppose the war is ended
by your means." His pack consisted of presents, being
principally several belts of wampum, curiously wrought,
and a red cloth blanket, the royal dress of Philip. These
he gave to Church, expressing his gratification in having an
opportunity of delivering them to him.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="illus-191.jpg" id="illus-191.jpg"></a>
   <img src="images/illus-191.jpg" alt="Capture of Annawon." title="Capture of Annawon."/>
   <p class="caption2">Capture of Annawon.</p>
</div>

<p>The remainder of the night they spent in discourse, in
which Annawon gave an account of his success and exploits
in former wars with the Indians when he served Asuhmequin,
Philip's father. Annawon, it is said, had confessed that he
had put to death several of the captive English, and could
not deny but that some of them had been tortured. Under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
these circumstances, and considering the exasperation which
the English naturally felt, it was hardly to be expected that
mercy should be shown him. Church, however, did not
intend that he should be put to death, and had earnestly
entreated for him; but in his absence from Plymouth, not
long after, the old chief was executed.</p>

<p>It is not uncommon with historians and others, to denounce
and execrate the conduct of Philip and his warriors, as
wanton and savage. They were doubtless cruel&mdash;they
were savage. The writer would not become their panegyrist.
But let it be remembered, that if they cannot be
exculpated, there are mitigating circumstances which should
always be mentioned in connection with their most inhuman
barbarities. The influences of Christianity never bore upon
them. They inflicted no greater tortures upon the English
than they often inflicted upon other prisoners of their own
complexion. But in addition, they were fighting for their
own country. They were patriots&mdash;and they saw in the
progress and prosperity of the English, the downfall of
Indian power&mdash;the annihilation of Indian title. They were
fathers, husbands, and full well did they know that soon
their family relations would be broken up&mdash;and the inheritance
of their children for ever fail. Who can blame them for
wishing to perpetuate their hold on their native hunting
grounds&mdash;or leaving to their posterity an inheritance dear
to them as ours is to us?&mdash;We cannot justify their treachery&mdash;their
indiscriminate and wholesale butcheries&mdash;but surely
we may admire their bravery&mdash;their endurance&mdash;their
patriotism.</p>

<p>During the three wars of King William, Queen Anne,
and George II., the sufferings of the northern colonies were
severe and protracted, or were intermitted only at short
intervals. The hostility of the Indians was kept alive, and
often kindled into a fresh flame, through the agency of
European settlers on their northern border. These took
up the quarrel of France and England, and sought occasions
to molest the subjects of the English sovereign in
America.</p>

<p>In <i>King William's War</i>, the French combined with the
Indians in bringing fire and sword upon the inhabitants of
New England and New York. A connected account need
not be given of the disastrous occurrences that took place,
during this sanguinary war; but only particular instances
of hostilities, and their effects, will be narrated in this portion
of the present work.</p>

<p>We commence with the attack on <i>Schenectady</i>. This was
made in pursuance of a plan adopted by Count Frontenac,
then the governor of Canada, in revenging on the English
colonies the treatment which King James had received
from the English government, and which had inflamed the
resentment of Frontenac's master, Louis XIV. The governor
fitted out three expeditions against the American
colonies in the midst of winter, of which one was against
New York. The attack on Schenectady was the fruit of
this expedition. It was made by a party, consisting of
about two hundred French and, perhaps, fifty Caughnewaga
Indians, under the command of two French officers, Maulet
and St. Helene, in 1689-90.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

   <img src="images/illus-194.jpg" alt="Burning of Schenectady." title="Burning of Schenectady."/>
   <p class="caption2">Burning of Schenectady.</p>
</div>

<p>Schenectady was then in the form of an oblong square,
having a gate at each extremity. But as one of the gates
only could be found, they all entered at that one. The
gate was not only open, but was also unguarded. Although
the town was impaled, and might have been protected, no
one deemed it necessary to close the gate at night, presuming
that the severity of the season was a sufficient
security. The enemy divided themselves into several parties,
and waylaid every portal, and then raised the war-whoop.
It was between eleven and twelve o'clock on
Saturday night, the 8th of February, when the fearful
tragedy commenced. Maulet attacked a garrison, where
the only resistance of any account was made. He soon
forced the gate, and all the English were slaughtered, and
the garrison burned. One of the French officers was
wounded, in forcing a house, and thereby wholly disabled;
but St. Helene having come to his assistance, the house was
taken and all who had shut themselves in it were put to
the sword. Nothing was now to be seen but massacre and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
pillage on every side. The most shocking barbarities were
committed on the inhabitants. "Sixty-three houses and
the church were immediately in a blaze. <i>Enciente</i> women,
in their expiring agonies, saw their infants cast into the
flames, being first delivered by the knife of the midnight
assassin. Sixty-three persons were murdered and twenty-seven
were carried into captivity."</p>

<p>A few persons were enabled to escape, but being without
sufficient clothing, they lost their limbs from the severity
of the cold, as they traveled towards Albany.</p>

<p>About noon, the next day, the enemy left the desolated
place, taking such plunder as they could carry with them,
and destroying the remainder. It was designed, it seems,
to spare the minister of the place, as Maulet wanted him
as his own prisoner; but he was found among the mangled
dead, and his papers burned. The houses of two or three
individuals were spared, for particular reasons, while the
rest were consigned to the flames.</p>

<p>Owing to the state of the traveling, news of the massacre
did not reach the great Mohawk castle, seventeen miles
distant, until at the expiration of two days. On the reception
of the news, a party commenced a pursuit of the foe.
After a tedious route, they fell upon their rear, killed and
took twenty-five of them, and effected some other damage.</p>

<p>The second party of French and Indians was sent against
the delightful settlement at <i>Salmon Falls</i>, on the Piscataqua.
At Three Rivers, Frontenac had fitted out an expedition of
fifty-two men and twenty-five Indians. They had an
officer at their head in whom the greatest confidence could
be reposed&mdash;Sieur Hertel. In his small band he had three
sons and two nephews. After a long and rugged march,
Hertel reached the place on the 27th of March, 1690. His
spies having reconnoitered it, he divided his men into three
companies, the largest portion of which he led himself.
The attack was made at the break of day. The English
made a stout resistance, but were unable to withstand the
well-directed fire of the assailants. Thirty of the bravest of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
the inhabitants were cut to pieces; the remainder, amounting
to fifty-four, were made prisoners. The English had
twenty-seven houses reduced to ashes, and two thousand
domestic animals perished in the barns that had been burned.</p>

<p>The third party, which was fitted out from Quebec by
the directions of Frontenac, made an attack upon <i>Casco</i>, in
Maine. This was commanded by M. de Portneuf. Hertel,
on his return to Canada, met with this expedition, and,
joining it with the force under his command, came back to
the scene of warfare in which he had been so unhappily
successful. As the hostile company marched through the
country of the Abenakis, numbers of them joined it. Portneuf,
with his forces thus augmented, came into the neighborhood
of Casco, according to the French account, on the
25th of May, 1690. On the following night, having prepared
an ambush, he succeeded in taking and killing an
Englishman who fell into it. Upon this occurrence, the
Indians raised the war-whoop, and about fifty English
soldiers, leaving the garrison to learn the occasion of it, had
nearly reached the ambush, when they were fired upon.
Before they could make resistance, they were fallen upon
by the French and Indians, who, with their swords and
tomahawks, made such a slaughter, that but four of them
escaped, and those with severe wounds. "The English,
seeing now that they must stand a siege, abandoned four
garrisons, and all retired into one which was provided with
cannon. Before these were abandoned, an attack was
made upon one of them, in which the French were repulsed
with the loss of one Indian killed, and one Frenchman
wounded. Portneuf began now to doubt of his ability to
take Casco, fearing the issue; for his commission only
ordered him to lay waste the English settlements, and not
to attempt fortified places. But, in this dilemma, Hertel
and Hopehood (a celebrated chief of the tribe of the Kennebecks),
arrived. It was now determined to press the siege.
In the deserted forts they found all the necessary tools for
carrying on the work, and they began a mine within fifty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
feet of the fort, under a steep bank, which entirely protected
them from its guns. The English became discouraged, and,
on the 28th of May, surrendered themselves prisoners of
war. There were seventy men, and probably a much
greater number of women and children; all of whom,
except Captain Davis, who commanded the garrison, and
three or four others, were given up to the Indians, who
murdered most of them in their most cruel manner; and,
if the accounts be true, Hopehood excelled all other
savages in acts of cruelty."</p>

<p>These barbarous transactions, producing alike terror and
indignation, aroused New England and New York to
attempt a formidable demonstration against the enemy.
The general court of Massachusetts sent letters of request
to the several executives of the provinces, pursuant to
which they convened at New York, May 1st, 1691. Two
important measures were adopted, as the result of the
deliberations, on this occasion&mdash;Connecticut sent General
Winthrop, with troops, to march through Albany, there to
receive supplies, and to be joined by a body of men from
New York. The expedition was to proceed up Lake
Champlain, and was destined for the destruction of Montreal.
There was a failure, however, of the supplies, and
thus the project was defeated. Massachusetts sent forth a
fleet of thirty-four sail, under Sir William Phipps. He
proceeded to Port Royal, took it, reduced Acadia, and
thence sailed up the St. Lawrence, with the design of capturing
Quebec. The troops landed, with some difficulty,
and the place was boldly summoned to surrender. A proud
defiance was returned by Frontenac. The position of the
latter happened to be strengthened, just at this time, by a
rëinforcement from Montreal. Phipps, learning this, and
finding also that the party of Winthrop, which he expected
from Montreal, had failed, gave up the attempt, and returned
to Boston, with the loss of several vessels and a considerable
number of troops. A part of his fleet had been
wrecked by a storm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<p>During the progress of King William's War, the atrocities
committed upon the colonists, by the French and
Indians, were equal to any recorded in the annals of the
most barbarous age. Connected with these, were instances
of heroic valor on the part of the sufferers, which are not
surpassed by any on the historic page. A specimen will
here be related: On the 15th of March, 1697, the last year
of King William's War, an attack was suddenly made on
<i>Haverhill</i>, in Massachusetts, by a party of about twenty
Indians. It was a rapid, but fatal onset, and a fitting <i>finale</i>
of so dreadful a ten years' war. Eight houses were
destroyed, twenty-seven persons killed, and thirteen carried
away prisoners. One of these houses belonged to a Mr.
Dustan, in the skirts of the town. Mr. Dustan was
engaged in work at some distance from home, but, by some
means, he learned what was passing at the place.</p>

<p>Before the Indians had reached his house, he had arrived
there, and been able to make some arrangements for the
removal of his wife and children. The latter he bid to run.
His wife, who had but only a few days before become the
mother of an infant, was in no condition to leave her bed.
He undertook, however, to remove her, but it was too late.
The Indians were rushing on. No time could be lost;
and Mr. Dustan turned with despair from the mother of
his children, to the children themselves. It became necessary
at once to hasten their flight&mdash;they were seven in
number, besides the infant left with its mother, the eldest
being seventeen years, and the youngest two years old.
The Indians were upon them, and what could the agonized
father do? With his gun he mounted his horse, and riding
in the direction of his children, overtook them only about
forty rods from the house. His first intention was to take
up the child that he could least spare, and escape with that.
But, alas! that point he was unable to decide&mdash;they were
all equally dear to him. He, therefore, determined to resist
the enemy, who was on a pursuit, and, if possible, save all.
Facing the savages, he fired, and they returned the fire.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
The Indians, however, did not choose to follow up the pursuit,
either from fear of the resolute father, who continued
to fire as he retreated, or from an apprehension of arousing
the neighboring English, before they could finish their
depredations in the town, and hence this part of the family
soon effected their escape.</p>

   <img src="images/illus-199.jpg" alt="Mr. Dustan saving his children." title="Mr. Dustan saving his children."/>
   <p class="caption2">Mr. Dustan saving his children.</p>
</div>

<p>We now return to the house. There was living in it a
nurse, Mrs. Neff, who heroically shared the fate of her
mistress, when escape was in her power. The Indians
entered the house, and, having ordered the sick woman to
rise and sit quietly in the corner of the fire-place, they
commenced the pillage of the dwelling, and concluded by
setting it on fire. At the approach of night, Mrs. Dustan
was forced to march into the wilderness, and seek repose
upon the hard, cold ground. Mrs. Neff, in attempting to
elude the Indians with the infant, was intercepted. The
babe was taken from her, and its brains beat out against a
neighboring tree. The captives, when collected, amounted
to thirteen in number. That same day they were marched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
twelve miles before encamping, although it was nearly
night before they set out. Succeeding this, for several
days, they were obliged to keep up with their savage comrades,
over an extent of country of not less than one hundred
and forty or fifty miles. Mrs. Dustan, feeble as she
had been, wonderfully supported the fatigue incident to
her situation.</p>

   <img src="images/illus-200.jpg" alt="Escape of Mrs. Dustan." title="Escape of Mrs. Dustan."/>
   <p class="caption2">Escape of Mrs. Dustan.</p>
</div>

<p>After this, the Indians, according to their custom, divided
their prisoners. Mrs. Dustan, Mrs. Neff, and a captive
lad from Worcester, fell to the share of an Indian family
consisting of twelve persons. These now took charge of
the captives, and appear to have treated them with no
unkindness, save that of forcing them to extend their journey
still farther towards an Indian settlement. They, however,
gave the prisoners to understand that there was one
ceremony to which they must submit, after they had arrived
at their place of destination, and that was to run the
gauntlet between two files of Indians. This announcement
filled Mrs. Dustan and her two companions with so much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
dread, that they mutually decided to attempt an escape.
Accordingly, after obtaining information from the Indians
themselves, as to the way of killing and scalping their
enemies, who gave the information without suspecting their
object, they laid their plans for taking the lives of the savages.
One night, "when the Indians were in the most
sound sleep, these three captives arose, and, softly arming
themselves with the tomahawks of their masters, allotted
the number each should kill; and so truly did they direct
their blows, that but two, a boy and a woman, made their
escape, the latter having been seriously wounded. Having
finished their fearful work, they hastily left the place. As
the scene of the exploit was a small island, in the mouth of
a stream that falls into the Merrimack, they made use of a
boat of the Indians to effect their escape; the others being
scuttled to prevent the use of them in pursuit, should the
Indians be near; and thus, with what provisions and arms
the Indian camp afforded, they embarked, and slowly took
the course of the river for their homes, which they reached
without accident."</p>

<p>The whole country was startled at the relation of the
heroic deed, the truth of which was never questioned.
The palpable proofs of their feat they brought with them,
and the general court of Massachusetts gave them fifty
pounds as a reward, and they received from individuals
likewise substantial tokens, expressing the admiration in
which the exploit was held. The governor of Maryland,
hearing of the transaction, sent them also a generous
present.</p>

<p>This is a case where individuals may, perhaps, differ in
opinion as to the strict moral propriety of the deed. The
necessity of such an act, for relief from suffering, may be
estimated differently, according to the different theories
which men have adopted. Yet it seems to have been
generally, if not universally approved by those who lived
contemporaneously with the transaction; and who, from the
stern integrity of their character, and from their acquaintance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
with the circumstances of the country, were peculiarly
well fitted to judge.</p>

<p>Such were some of the striking events during the period
of King William's War; a war which continued nearly ten
years, and brought incalculable distress upon the colonies.
The peace of Ryswick, in 1697, put an end to it; but this
peace proved to be of short duration.</p>

and Sufferings of Rev. Mr. Williams&mdash;Other Disasters of the War&mdash;Peace&mdash;Death
of Queen Anne&mdash;Accession of George I.&mdash;Continued Sufferings

with the Indians at Boston.</p></blockquote>

<p>King William having deceased in 1702, Queen Anne
was seated on the British throne, and war soon began again
to rage throughout Europe. England and France, including
Spain also, drew the sword, to settle some unadjusted claims
between them, and the contest of the parent countries, as
usual, soon involved their American colonies. The states
of Massachusetts and New Hampshire, became the principal
scenes of the war in America, the colony of New York
being secured from aggression through the neutrality of
the Five Nations on her borders. The war, which lasted
more than ten years, is generally denominated <i>Queen Anne's
War</i>, and was attended with the usual barbarous and
distressing results incident to savage warfare.</p>

<p>The drama opened at <i>Deerfield</i>, on the Connecticut river,
on the 19th of February, 1704. The preliminaries to it
had occurred a little before in the destruction of several
small settlements from Casco to Wells in Maine, and the
killing and capture of one hundred and thirty people in
the aggregate. This was in contravention to the solemn
assurance given by the eastern Indians, of peace with New
England. As Deerfield was a frontier town, the enemy
had watched it for the purpose of capture from an early
period. Indeed, it had been constantly exposed to inroads,
during King William's War, but had resolutely maintained
its ground, and increased in size and population, especially
from the termination of that war. It was palisaded, though
imperfectly; several detached houses were protected by
slight fortifications, and twenty soldiers had been placed
within it. They had, however, been quartered about in
different houses, and, forgetting their duty as soldiers, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
surprised with the rest of the inhabitants. There was a
great depth of snow upon the ground, a circumstance which
gave the enemy an easy entrance over the pickets. The
commander of the French was Hertel de Rouville.</p>

<p>The assailants, in approaching the place, used every precaution
to avoid disturbing the soldiery or the inhabitants
by noise in walking over the crusted snow, stopping occasionally,
that the sound of their feet might appear like the
fitful gusts of the wind. But the precaution was unnecessary,
for the guard within the fort had retired, and fallen asleep.
None, of all who were in the village, awaked, except to be
put immediately into the sleep of death; to be doomed to a
a horrible captivity, or to effect a difficult and hazardous
escape into the adjacent woods amidst the snows of winter.
The houses were assaulted by parties detached in different
directions; the doors were broken open, the astonished
people dragged from their beds, and pillage and personal
violence in all its forms ensued. They who attempted
resistance, were felled by the tomahawk or musket.</p>

   <p class="caption2">Capture of Mr. Williams.</p>
</div>

<p>Some of the separate features of this work of destruction
and scene of agony, deserve particular notice, and will
ever call up the painful sympathies of the reader of history.
The minister of the place, the Rev. John Williams, who
subsequently wrote a narrative of the affair, and of his own
captivity, was a conspicuous actor and sufferer in the sad
tragedy. Early in the assault, which was not long before
the break of day, about twenty Indians attacked his house.
Instantly leaping from his bed, he ran towards the door, and
perceived a party making their entrance into the house.
He called to awaken two soldiers who were sleeping in the
chamber, and had only returned to the bedside for his arms,
when the enemy rushed into the room. Upon this, as he
says, "I reached my hands up to the bed-tester for my
pistol, uttering a short petition to God, expecting a present
passage through the <i>valley of the shadow of death</i>." He
levelled it at the breast of the foremost Indian, but it missed
fire: he was immediately seized by three Indians, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
secured his pistol, and, binding him fast, kept him naked in
the cold, nearly the space of an hour. One of these captors
was a leader or captain, who soon met the fate he merited.
Says Mr. Williams, "the judgment of God did not long
slumber, for by sun-rising he received a mortal shot from
my next neighbor's house." This house was not a garrison,
but being defended by seven resolute men, and as many
resolute women, withstood the efforts of three hundred
French and Indians. They attacked it repeatedly, and
tried various methods to set it on fire, but without success;
in the mean while suffering from the fire which was poured
upon them from the windows and loop-holes of the building.
The enemy gave up the attempt in despair. Mrs. Williams
having been confined but a few weeks previously, was
feeble&mdash;a circumstance which rendered her case hopeless;
but her agony was intensely increased by witnessing the
murder of two of her little ones, who were dragged to the
door, and butchered, as was also a black woman belonging
to the family. Rifling the house with the utmost rudeness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
the enemy seized Mrs. Williams, ill as she was, and five
remaining children, with a view to carry them into captivity.</p>

<p>While these transactions were in progress, a lodger in
the house, Captain Stoddard, seized his cloak, and leaped
from a chamber window. He escaped across Deerfield
river, and finding it necessary to secure his feet from injury,
he tore the cloak into pieces, and wrapped them up in it,
and was thus enabled, though in great exhaustion, to reach
Hatfield. An assault was made upon the house of Captain
John Sheldon, but the door was so strong and so firmly
bolted, that the enemy found it difficult to break or penetrate
it. Their only resort, therefore, was to perforate it with
their tomahawks. Through the aperture thus made, they
thrust a musket, fired, and killed Mrs. Sheldon, a ball
striking her as she was rising from her bed in an adjoining
room. The mark of the ball was long to be seen in a
timber near the bed, the house having been carefully
preserved, bearing upon the front door the marks of
the Indian hatchet. In the mean time, the son and son's
wife of Captain Sheldon, sprang from a chamber window
at the east end of the building; but unfortunately for the
lady, her ankle became sprained by the fall, and being
unable to walk, she was seized by the Indians. The husband
escaped into the adjoining forest, and reached Hatfield.
The enemy at length gaining possession of the house,
reserved it on account of its size as a dépôt for the prisoners
taken in the village.</p>

<p>At the expiration of about two hours, the enemy having
collected the prisoners, and plundered and set fire to the
buildings, took up their march from the place. Forty-seven
persons had been put to death, including those killed in
making the defence. "We were carried over the river to
the foot of the mountain, about a mile from my house," says
Mr. Williams, "where we found a great number of our
Christian neighbors&mdash;men, women, and children&mdash;to the
number of one hundred, nineteen of whom were afterwards
murdered in the way, and two starved to death near Coos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
in a time of great scarcity and famine the savages underwent
there. When we came to the foot of the mountain,
they took away our shoes, and gave us Indian shoes, to
prepare us for our journey."</p>

<p>At this spot, a portion of the enemy was overtaken by a
party of the English, consisting of the few who had escaped,
together with the men who had defended the two houses,
and a small number from Hatfield, and a brisk fight ensued.
The little band, however, was in danger of being surrounded
by the main body of the enemy's troops, as they
came into the action, and, accordingly, they were compelled
to retreat. They left nine of their number slain. The
attack on the enemy, under such circumstances, indicated
the resolute and sympathizing spirit of the people, but it
had well nigh proved fatal to the prisoners. Rouville, fearing,
at one time, a defeat, had ordered the latter to be put
to death, but, providentially, the bearer of the message was
killed before he executed his orders. They were, nevertheless,
held in readiness to be sacrificed in the event of
disasters happening to the enemy.</p>

<p>Soon after the termination of the skirmish, Rouville
commenced his march for Canada. Three hundred miles
of a trackless wilderness were to be traversed, and that too
at a very inclement season of the year. The prospects of
the captives were gloomy beyond description. Many were
women, at that time under circumstances requiring the
most tender treatment. Some were young children, not
sufficiently strong to endure the fatigues of traveling.
Infants there were, who must be carried in their parents'
arms, or left behind to be butchered by the savage or frozen
on the snow; and, of the adult males, several were suffering
from severe wounds.</p>

<p>The first day's journey was but four miles, and was signalized
by the murder of an infant. The Indians, however,
seemed disposed generally to favor the captives, by carrying
on their backs such children as were incapable of
traveling. From mercenary motives, they wished to keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
all alive that they could, as the captives would bring a
price, or be serviceable to them in some way, in Canada.
It was no sentiment of compassion that moved them; for, as
soon as their patience failed them, the miserable captive,
whether man, woman, or child, was knocked on the head.
At night, they encamped in a meadow, in what is now
Greenfield, where they cleared away the snow, spread
boughs of trees, and made slight cabins of brush, for the
accommodation of the prisoners. The strongest of the latter
were bound after the Indian manner that night, and every
subsequent night, in order to prevent escape. In the very
first night, one man broke away and escaped, and, at the same
time, Mr. Williams, who was considered the principal of the
captives, was informed by the commander-in-chief, that if any
more attempted to escape, the rest should be put to death.</p>

<p>In the second day's march occurred the death of Mrs.
Williams. In the course of the route, it became necessary
to cross Creek river, at the upper part of Deerfield
meadow. From some change of conductors, Mr. Williams,
who had before been forbidden to speak to his fellow-captives,
was now permitted to do it, and even to assist his
distressed wife, who had begun to be exhausted. But it
was their last meeting, and most affecting was the scene.
She very calmly told him that her strength was fast failing,
and that he would soon lose her. At the same time, she
did not utter the language of discouragement or of complaint,
in view of the hardness of her fortune. When the
company halted, Mr. Williams' former conductor resumed
his place, and ordered him into the front, and his wife
was obliged to travel unaided. They had now arrived
at the margin of Green river. This they passed by
wading through the water, which was about two feet in
depth, and running with great rapidity. They now came
to a steep mountain, which it was necessary to ascend.
The narrative of Mr. Williams says, here: "No sooner had
I overcome the difficulty of that ascent, but I was permitted
to sit down, and to be unburthened of my pack. I sat pitying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
those who were behind, and entreated my master to let
me go down and help my wife, but he refused. I asked
each of the prisoners, as they passed by me, after her, and
heard that, passing through the above said river, she fell
down, and was plunged all over in the water; after which,
she traveled not far; for, at the foot of the mountain, the
cruel and blood-thirsty savage who took her, slew her with
his hatchet, at one stroke." The same day, a young woman
and child were killed and scalped.</p>

<p>After some days, they reached the mouth of White river,
where Rouville divided his force into several parties, who took
different routes to the St. Lawrence. Mr. Williams belonged
to a party which reached the Indian village St. Francis, on
the St. Lawrence, by the way of Lake Champlain. After a
short residence at that village, he was sent to Montreal, where
he was treated with kindness by the governor, Vaudreuil.</p>

<p>In the year 1706, fifty-seven of these captives were conveyed
to Boston in a flag-ship, among whom were Mr. Williams
and all his remaining children (two having been ransomed
and sent home before), except his daughter Eunice,
whom, notwithstanding all his exertions, he was never able to
redeem, and whom, at the tender age of ten years, he was
obliged to leave among the Indians. As she grew up under
Indian influence, having no other home, and no other friends
who could counsel and guide her, she adopted the manners
and customs of the Indians, settled with them in a domestic
state, and, by her husband, had several children. She
became also, it is said, a Catholic, and ever afterwards
firmly attached to that religion. This, perhaps, is scarcely
a matter of surprise, as the sentiment was, the more easily
instilled into her mind, from her age and the circumstances
in which she was placed. Some time after the war,
she visited her relations at Deerfield, in company with her
husband. She was habited in the Indian costume, and,
strange as it may seem, though every persuasive was used
to induce her to abandon the savages, and to remain among
her connections, all was in vain. She continued to lead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
the life of a savage, and, though she repeated her visits to
her friends in New England, she uniformly persisted in
wearing her blanket and counting her beads. Two of the
children of Mr. Williams, after their return, became worthy
and respectable ministers; one at Waltham, the other at
Long Meadow, in Springfield.</p>

<p>The captive Mr. Williams, upon his return to the colony,
was desired, by the remnant of his Deerfield friends, to
resume the duties of his pastoral office in that place. He
complied with their request, and, having rëmarried, reared
another family of children, and died in 1729.</p>

<p>During Queen Anne's War, no other single tragedy
occurred like that of Deerfield; but, at all times, the enemy
were prowling about the frontier settlements, watching, in
concealment, for an opportunity to strike a sudden blow,
and, having done irreparable mischief, to escape with safety.
The women and children retired into garrisons; the men
left their fields uncultivated, or labored with arms at their
sides, and having sentinels posted at every point whence
an attack could be apprehended. Yet, notwithstanding
these precautions, the Indians were often successful, killing
sometimes an individual, sometimes a whole family, sometimes
a band of laborers, ten or twelve in number; and, so
alert were they in their movements, that but few of them
fell into the hands of the whites.</p>

<p>Queen Anne died in 1714, and George I., of the house
of Brunswick, ascended the throne of England. During
the reign of the latter, a state of warfare existed between
the enemy and the colony of Massachusetts and New
Hampshire for several years, distressing to the former, but
attended by few signal conflicts, disasters, or victories. At
length, however, it was discovered that the Indians,
although instigated still by the French, were not averse to
peace. Accordingly, towards the latter part of the year
1725, a treaty was concluded at Boston, and the next spring
was ratified at Falmouth. A period of tranquillity succeeded
this event in the northern colonies.</p>

<p>The attempts to maintain peace with the Indians were
successful through a number of years. The most happy
expedient which the English adopted for that purpose, was
the erection of <i>trading-houses</i>, where goods were furnished
by government to be exchanged for furs, which the Indians
brought to them. This had the effect of conciliating the
Indians, and, as it stimulated their industry, it was more
serviceable to them than direct gifts. In the course of time,
however, they began to be restive. Their intercourse with
the whites, for trading purposes, renewed reminiscences of
the attacks and cruelties committed upon the exterior settlements.
The Indians were wont to boast of their feats,
and of the tortures inflicted upon the captured English; in
some instances, the friends of those with whom they were
now holding intercourse. They were disposed frequently,
when provoked or intoxicated, to threaten to come again,
with the war-whoop and the tomahawk. Hence, individual
acts of violence occasionally took place, at or near the
trading-towns, and it was evident that, whenever war
between the English and French should commence, there
would be a reiteration of the former scenes and acts of
atrocity.</p>

<p>The day of blood at length arrived. It was in the year
1744, that England and France again commenced hostilities.
The intelligence no sooner crossed the Atlantic, than
the frontiers of the colonies became the area of the conflict,
and the blood-thirsty savage took up his hatchet, with the
intention of giving vent to his long pent-up vengeance.
George II. had been on the throne several years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<p>Before the proclamation of war was known at Boston,
the French governor of Cape Breton sent a party to take
Canso, which was effected, and the captives were conveyed
to Louisburg. The proclamation of war seems to have had
a singular effect on the Indians, who had manifested a
degree of attachment to the whites. It awakened the
naturally ferocious feelings of the savage&mdash;feelings that
had been for some time suspended; and, forgetting the many
ties of acquaintance and friendly intercourse, he easily fell
back upon those habits of carnage and plunder, in which
he was originally nurtured. The effect of the proclamation
of war, on all the other Indians, was to have been
expected, as gratifying their long-indulged desires of mingling
in the scenes of murder and pillage. It was an unhappy
circumstance, in regard to the Indians who had been
indulged with so intimate an intercourse with the whites,
that they were perfectly acquainted with all the routes
from Canada to the various English settlements, thus serving
as guides for others, or facilitating their predatory
irruptions.</p>

<p>With a wise foresight, upon the first intimation of war,
several new forts were ordered to be built in exposed
parts of the country, the western regiments of militia in
Massachusetts were called on for their quotas of men to
defend the frontiers in that quarter, and scouting parties
were employed in various places for the purpose of discovering
the incursions of the enemy, and ferreting out
their trails. But happily, during the first year, they
remained quiet, or were secretly making their preparations
for the part they intended hereafter to enact.</p>

<p>The Indians commenced operations in July, 1745, at the
<i>Great Meadow</i>, now Putney, on the Connecticut, and a few
days after at upper Ashuelot (Keene), killing at each place
an individual. Somewhat later in the year, the Great
Meadow was the scene of another attack, with a small
loss to the whites, as also to the Indians. The vigilance
of the colonists, however, was so unceasing, that but little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
opportunity at this time was afforded for the gratification
of their malignity.</p>

<p>The eyes of the New England colonists were now fixed
on one great enterprise, the reduction of <i>Louisburg</i>, on the
island of Cape Breton, a place of incredible strength, which
had been twenty-five years in building. Accordingly, four
thousand troops from the several colonies, as far as Pennsylvania,
were raised, the command of which was assigned to
William Pepperell. On the 4th of April, 1745, the expedition
had arrived at Canso. Here they were detained three
weeks on account of the ice. At length Commodore Warren,
according to orders from England, arrived at Canso in a
ship of sixty guns, with three other ships of forty guns each.
After a consultation with Pepperell, the commodore proceeded
to cruise before Louisburg. Soon after, the general
sailed with the whole fleet. On the 30th of April, landing
his troops, he invested the city. A portion of the troops on
the north-east part of the harbor, meeting with the warehouses
containing the naval stores, set them on fire. The
smoke, driven by the wind into the grand battery, so
terrified the French, that they abandoned it. After spiking
the guns, they returned to the city. Colonel Vaughan, who
conducted the first column, took possession of the deserted
battery. With extreme difficulty, cannon were drawn up
for fourteen nights successively, from the landing-place,
through a morass to the camp. It was done by men with
straps over their shoulders, and sinking to their knees in
the mud; a service which oxen or horses on such ground
could not have performed. The cannon of the forsaken
battery were drilled, and turned with good effect on the city.</p>

<p>On the 7th of May, a summons was sent to the commanding
officer of Louisburg, but he refused to surrender the
place. The efforts of the assailants were then renewed,
and put forth to the utmost, both by the commodore's fleet
and the land forces. Their efforts were at length crowned
with success. Discouraged by the whole aspect of affairs,
Duchambon, the French commander, felt under the necessity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
of surrendering; and, accordingly, on the 16th of June,
articles of capitulation were signed.</p>

   <p class="caption2">Reduction of Louisburg.</p>
</div>

<p>This expedition, and its success, are one of the most
striking events in American warfare. It established the
New England character for a daring and enterprising
spirit, and it became equally the boast and the fear of
Britain. The daring and the prowess that effected such
an achievement, might one day be arrayed against the
integrity of the British empire in America. Pious people
considered that this victory was wrought out by a special
guiding and cöoperating Providence.</p>

<p>After the loss of Louisburg, the conflicts on the borders
became more frequent and fatal. The enemy was exasperated,
and determined to give the colonists no rest. Various
places on the Connecticut were accordingly attacked, but
chiefly settlements in New Hampshire, the results of which
were very distressing to individual families. Charlestown,
Keene, New Hopkinton, Contoocook, Rochester, and many
other places whose situations exposed them to the enemy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
were attacked, and a greater or less number of individuals
were killed, wounded, or captured.</p>

<p>One attack may be stated in detail; it followed the surrender
of Fort Massachusetts to Vaudreuil's French and
Indian forces, an honourable capitulation, which took place
in the summer of 1746, the fort having defended itself as
long as its ammunition lasted. The narrative is given in
the language of another: "Immediately after the surrender
of Fort Massachusetts, about fifty of Vaudreuil's Indians
passed Hoosack mountain, for the purpose of making depredations
at Deerfield, about forty miles eastward. Arriving
near the village on Sunday, they reconnoitered the north
meadow, for the purpose of selecting a place of attack upon
the people, as they should commence their labor the next
morning. Not finding a point of attack suited to their
design, which seems to have been rather to capture than to
secure scalps, they proceeded about two miles south, to a
place called the <i>Bars</i>, where were a couple of houses,
owned by the families of Arnsden and Allen, but now
deserted; and early in the morning formed an ambuscade
on the margin of a meadow, under the cover of a thicket
of alders, near which was a quantity of mown hay. The
laborers of the two families, accompanied by several children,
then residing in Deerfield village, proceeded to their
work in the early part of the day, and commenced their
business very near the Indians, who now considered their
prey as certain. But a little before they commenced their
attack, Mr. Eleazer Hawks, one of the neighboring inhabitants,
went out for fowling; and, approaching near the
ambuscade, was shot down and scalped. Alarmed at the
fire, the persons fled down a creek towards a mill, fiercely
pursued by the Indians. Simeon Arnsden, a lad, was
seized, killed and scalped; Samuel Allen, John Sadler, and
Adonijah Gillet, made a stand under the bank of Deerfield
river, near the mouth of the mill creek, whence they opened
a fire on the Indians. Soon overpowered, Allen and Gillet
fell; but Sadler escaped to an island, and thence across the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
river, under a shower of balls. In the mean time, others,
making for the road leading to the town, were closely pursued,
and Oliver Arnsden, after a vigorous struggle for his
life, was barbarously butchered. Eunice, a daughter, and
two sons of Allen (Samuel and Caleb) were in the field;
Eunice was knocked down by a tomahawk, and her skull
fractured, but, in the hurry, was left unscalped. Samuel
was made prisoner, and Caleb effected his escape by running
through a piece of corn, though the Indians passed
very near him. Notwithstanding the severity of her
wounds, Eunice recovered, and lived to an advanced age."<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>Although the war between England and France was
terminated by the treaty of peace at Aix-la-Chapelle, on the
18th of October, 1743, yet tranquillity did not immediately
follow. The frontiers continued to be ravaged, and the
comfort and progress of the settlers were seriously interrupted,
for a time, beyond the general pacification. The
basis of the peace, as settled at Aix-la-Chapelle, was the
mutual restoration of all places taken during the war:
Louisburg, the pride and glory of the war, reverted to the
French, to the grief and mortification of New England.</p>

<p>After a few years of peace, during which the colonies
had somewhat repaired their wasted strength and resources,
a declaration of war was made between Great Britain and
France in the summer of 1756. There had been an actual
state of warfare for two previous years, causing no small
grief and annoyance to the colonies, who had fondly hoped
longer to enjoy the blessings of tranquillity, and prosecute
their schemes of improvement. An invaluable blessing,
however, ultimately flowed from the renewed conflict of
arms&mdash;as, from this time, that federation took place among
the separated provinces, which was consummated afterwards
in their independence as a nation. The prosecution
of a common object, such as was presented in the French
and Indian War, naturally concentrated and united their
energies, and evolved, at length, the idea of a more perfect
political association.</p>

<p>The <i>causes</i> of the war grew out of the encroachments
of the French upon the frontier of the English colonies in
America. Such, at least, was the allegation on the part of
England. France had established settlements on the St.
Lawrence, and at the mouth of the Mississippi, and commenced
the gigantic plan of uniting these points by a chain
of forts, extending across the continent, and designed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
confine the English colonists to the eastern slope of the
Alleghanies. The French possessed considerable military
strength in their northern colonies. They had strongly
fortified Quebec and Montreal, and, at other points, the
frontiers were defended by Louisburg, Cape Breton, and
the forts of Lake Champlain, Niagara, Crown Point, Frontenac,
and Ticonderoga. And they had, also, a fort of
some strength at Du Quesne, now the spot on which Pittsburg
is built.</p>

<p>The establishment of French posts on the Ohio, and the
attack on Colonel Washington, were declared, by the
British government, as the commencement of hostilities.
The French, however, allege the intrusion of the Ohio Company
upon their territory, as the immediate cause of the
war. General Braddock, at the head of fifteen hundred
troops, had been despatched to America. On his arrival in
Virginia, he requested a convention of colonial governors to
meet him there, to confer on the plan of the ensuing campaign.
They accordingly met, and three expeditions were
resolved upon&mdash;one against Du Quesne, to be conducted by
General Braddock; one against forts Niagara and Frontenac,
to be commanded by Governor Shirley; and one
against Crown Point, to be led by General Johnson. The
last-named expedition was a measure proposed by Massachusetts,
and was to be executed by troops raised in New
England and New York. In the mean time, a fourth expedition,
which had been previously concerted, was carried
on against the French forts in Nova Scotia. This province,
it seems, after its cession to the English, by the treaty
of Utrecht, was still retained, in part, by the French, as its
boundaries were not defined. They had built forts on a
portion of it which the English claimed. To gain possession
of these, was the object of the expedition. About two
thousand militia, under Monckton and Winslow, embarked
at Boston, on the 20th of May, 1755; and, having been
joined by three hundred regulars, when they had arrived
at Chignecto, on the Bay of Fundy, they proceeded against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
Beau Sejour, now the principal post of the French in
that country.</p>

<p>This place they invested and took possession of, after
a bombardment of a few days. Other forts were afterwards
attacked and taken, and the whole province was
secured to the British, according to their idea of its proper
boundaries.</p>

<p>The military operations at the South, during this time,
proved to be disastrous in the extreme. One of the most
signal defeats took place in Virginia, that the annals of
American history have recorded. It had been a total loss
of a large army (large for the colonial warfare), but for the
prudence and valor of our youthful Fabius, George Washington.
He saved a portion of it, while the whole was
exposed to utter annihilation, through the pride and ill-calculating
policy of its leader. General Braddock was not
wanting in valor, or in the knowledge of European tactics;
but he little understood the proper mode of meeting Indian
warfare, and had the greater misfortune of unwillingness
to receive advice from subordinates in office.</p>

<p>The object of the expedition under Braddock, was the
reduction of Fort du Quesne. At the head of two thousand
men, he commenced his march; but, as it was deemed
an object of great importance to reach the fort before it
could be rëinforced, he marched forward with twelve hundred
men, selected from the different corps, with ten pieces
of cannon, and the necessary ammunition and provisions.
The remainder of the army was left under the command
of Colonel Dunbar, to follow with the heavy artillery,
by moderate and easy marches.</p>

<p>Washington, who was his aid, and well acquainted with
the peculiarities of Indian warfare, foresaw the danger
which was impending, and ventured to suggest the propriety
of employing a body of Indians, who had offered
their services. These, had the commander seen fit to
accept the advice, would have proved serviceable to him
as scouting and advanced parties. Or had he, as was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
also suggested to him, as a matter of safety, placed the
provincial troops in his army in front, he would have
avoided the danger. These troops, consisting of independent
and ranging companies, accustomed to such services,
would have scoured the woods and morasses, and
guarded against an ambuscade. Despising the enemy,
undervaluing the colonial troops, and confiding only in his
own valor and the splendid array of his well-drilled British
regulars, he fearlessly pursued his way. The natural and
necessary impediments were many, and he did not reach
the Monongahela until the 8th of July. The next day he
expected to invest the fort, and in the morning he made
a disposition of his forces, in accordance with that expectation.
His van, consisting of three hundred British regulars,
was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Gage, and he
followed, at some distance, with the artillery and main
body of his men, divided into small columns.</p>

<p>"Washington had the day before rëjoined the army, from
which he had been a short time detained by severe illness.
It was noon on the 9th of July, when, from the height above
the right bank of the Monongahela, he looked upon the
ascending army, which, ten miles from Fort Du Quesne, had
just crossed the stream for the second time. Every thing
looked more bright and beautiful than aught he had ever
witnessed before. The companies in their crimson uniform,
with burnished arms and floating banners, were marching
gayly to cheerful music as they entered the forest."</p>

<p>But soon and suddenly, how changed the scene! How
many exulting soldiers that entered the forest, were destined
never to emerge from it, into the light of day! How many
hearts that were throbbing with hope at the prospect of an
easy victory, were to be hushed for ever! Heedless of
danger, Braddock pressed forward, the distance of seven
miles only still intervening between his army and the contemplated
place of action. Suddenly, in an open wood,
thick set with high grass, there burst upon them the Indian
war-whoop and a fierce fire from an unseen enemy on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
every side. A momentary confusion and panic ensued&mdash;many
fell, and, the ranks being broken, there was danger
of an ignominious flight. None could at first tell who
might be or where lurked the foe that was dealing death
at so fearful a rate. Braddock, however, rallied his forces,
but mistakingly deemed it necessary to fight, even under
these circumstances, according to European tactics, and to
preserve a regular order of battle. Thus he kept his
soldiers in compact masses, as fair marks for the Indian
bullet or arrow, without the possibility of effectually meeting
the foe. At this critical moment, personal valor was of no
avail. Discipline and art, combined action, and orderly
movement, brought not the enemy where he could be
foiled. There was, indeed, a momentary suspension of the
fight, resulting from the fall of the commanding officer of
the foe, but the attack was quickly renewed with increased
fury&mdash;the van fell back on the main army, and the whole
body was again thrown into confusion. Had an instant
retreat, or a rapid charge without observance of orderly
military movements been commanded, the result might
have been very different. But Braddock, too ignorant of
the right course, or too bigoted to the European method of
battle, refused to adopt either expedient. Continually fired
upon, and losing his brave men by scores, he still made
efforts to form his broken and wasting troops on the very
spot where they were first attacked, thus bringing the living
to supply the places of the dead, and offering needlessly,
and without any countervailing advantage, successive holocausts
to the demon of battle.</p>

<p>The enemy was small in numbers, and hardly calculated
on the possibility of defeating the English army. Annoyance
and delay, seemed to be all that they expected to
accomplish; but permitted securely, in the two ravines on
each side of the road where they were concealed, to fire
upon the English, they could but triumph. The Indians,
taking leisurely aim at the officers, swept them from the
field, and all but Washington were either killed or wounded.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
He, as aid to Braddock, was peculiarly exposed, as he rode
over every part of the field to carry the general's orders.
Indeed, the sharp-shooters endeavored to take him off, as
well as the rest, but he was providentially preserved. No
instrument of death might be wielded with effect upon him.
The superstitious Indians were struck by the phenomenon
of his escape, and concluded that he was not to be killed.
One of them afterwards averred that he shot at him seventeen
times in succession, and was forced to yield to the
conviction that he was invulnerable. At the close of the
battle, four bullets were found in his coat, and it was known
that two horses had been killed under him.</p>

   <img src="images/illus-222.jpg" alt="Braddock's Defeat." title="Braddock's Defeat."/>
   <p class="caption2">Braddock's Defeat.</p>
</div>

<p>After an action of three hours, General Braddock, who
had fearlessly breasted the vollies of the enemy, and had
lost successively three horses from under him, received a
mortal wound. His troops no longer maintained their
position, but fled in terror and dismay. The provincials
remained last on the field, and effected an orderly retreat,
protecting, at the same time, the regulars in their flight.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
The defeat was most signal, and the loss of life appalling.
The proud army, at the close of the contest, counted but
one-half of its entire number. Sixty-four officers were
killed and wounded. The remains of the English forces
sought their companions under Dunbar, forty miles distant.
Braddock could proceed no farther, and there expired.
The army, with Dunbar for its leader, was soon after
marched to Philadelphia, where it found its winter-quarters.
Thus, in the fatal results of that expedition, the whole frontier
of Virginia was left exposed to the French and Indians.</p>

<p>Of the enterprise against <i>Niagara</i> and <i>Fort Frontenac</i>,
it may suffice to say, that it utterly failed. We proceed,
therefore, to that against <i>Crown Point</i>, the rendezvous for
which was at Albany. On the last of June (1755), four
thousand troops arrived at Albany, under the command of
General William Johnson and General Lyman. Here the
sachem Hendrick joined them with a body of his Mohawks.
As a portion of the troops, together with the artillery,
batteaux, provisions, and other necessaries for the attempt
on Crown Point, could not be immediately got ready, General
Lyman advanced with the main body, and erected Fort
Edward, on the Hudson, for the security of the apparatus
above named, which was to be forwarded by Johnson.</p>

<p>Towards the end of August, General Johnson moved his
forces forward more northerly, and pitched his camp at the
south end of Lake George. Here he learned that two
thousand French and Indians, under the command of Baron
Dieskau, had landed at South bay, now Whitehall, and
were marching toward Fort Edward for the purpose of
destroying the English transports and munitions of war.
It was resolved the next morning, in a council of war, to
send out a large detachment of men to intercept Dieskau's
army on its way. To perform this service, Colonel Ephraim
Williams, of Deerfield, was appointed, at the head of twelve
hundred troops, two hundred of whom were Indians.
Dieskau, who was an able commander, had made an advantageous
disposition to receive the English. While he kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
the main body of his regulars with him in the center, he
ordered the Canadians and Indians to advance on the right
and left in the woods, with a view to surround their opponents.
When the American troops had arrived considerably
within the ambuscade, the Mohawk sachem, Hendrick, who
had been sent out too late with his band, was hailed by a
hostile Indian, and instantly there commenced a sharp fire.
This brought on the action sooner than was intended by
Dieskau, who had ordered his flanking parties to reserve
their fire till the firing should proceed from the center. It
was his design to let the English troops get completely
inclosed before the firing commenced, in which case there
would have been an entire defeat of the English. The
discharge of arms necessarily became general, after the
flanking parties had begun; but the advantage was altogether
on the side of the ambuscaders. The provincials
fought bravely, but finding that they were in danger of
being hemmed in from every quarter, they were obliged to
retreat. The loss of the Americans was considerable.
Colonel Williams was killed. Hendrick and a number of
his Indians, who fought with great intrepidity, were left dead
on the field. The retreating troops joined the main body,
and waited the approach of their now exulting assailants.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>It was nearly noon when the enemy appeared in sight of
Johnson's army. The battle of <i>Lake George</i>, which was
the consequence of their meeting, occurred on the 8th of
September. The American army was encamped on the
banks of that lake, and covered each side of a low thick
morass. To form a sort of breastwork, trees had been
felled, and this was his only cover against an attack. It
happened most favorably that, two days before, General
Johnson had received several cannon from Fort Edward.
The enemy marched up in front of the breastwork within
the distance of one hundred and fifty yards. Soon the
grand and central attack was commenced, while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
English flanks were beset by the Canadians and Indians.
The distant platoon fire of the French did but little execution;
and the English, summoning resolution, entered with
increased spirit upon the defence of their position. Working
their artillery with vigor, they compelled the Indians and
Canadian militia to flee into the swamps. Dieskau, under
these circumstances, was forced to order a retreat. It was
not effected with much success, as his troops were thrown
into irrecoverable disorder, and their flight was hastened
by a party pursuing them from the English camp. The
baron met the frequent fate of war&mdash;he received his
death-wound from a soldier, who, meeting him alone, mistook
a movement on the part of the general, which was
intended as propitiatory, for an attempt at self-defence, and
discharged his piece at him. He was feeling for his watch
to give to the soldier. His wound proved fatal, but not
until he had reached England.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

   <img src="images/illus-225.jpg" alt="Battle of Lake George." title="Battle of Lake George."/>
   <p class="caption2">Battle of Lake George.</p>
</div>

<p>When the baron's army halted, after its retreat or flight,
it happened, just as they were about to take refreshment, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
two hundred men of the New Hampshire forces, which
had been detached from Fort Edward to the aid of the
main body, fell upon the French, and put many of them to
the sword. Their dead bodies were thrown into a small
lake, which, from this circumstance, was afterwards called
"the bloody pond."</p>

<p>The spirits of the colonists, which had been so depressed
by Braddock's defeat, were greatly revived, but the issue
of the battle of Lake George was not otherwise beneficial.
The success was by no means followed up according to
the expectations of the country. No further effort at this
time was made to reduce Crown Point; but the remainder
of the campaign was employed by Johnson only in strengthening
the works at Fort Edward, and erecting on the site
of the battle a fort, which he called William Henry.</p>

<p>Johnson, in his official letter respecting the engagement,
makes no mention of General Lyman, although the latter
held the command most of the day, as Johnson was wounded
early in the action. This was an instance of ingratitude
and selfishness highly unbecoming a soldier, especially as
the consideration bestowed on himself was a baronetcy and
five thousand pounds sterling.</p>

<p>The campaign of 1756, the year in which the public
declaration of war was made, makes but an indifferent
figure in American history. Expeditions against Niagara,
Crown Point, Fort Du Quesne, and other places, were
projected; but they severally failed. On the other hand,
before the close of the summer, the Marquis de Montcalm,
an efficient officer, who succeeded Dieskau, with a large
force of regulars, Canadians, and Indians, took the important
fort of Oswego, on the south side of Lake Ontario, which
gave him the command of the lakes Ontario and Erie, and
of the entire country of the Five Nations. Sixteen hundred
men were taken prisoners; Colonel Mercer, the commanding
officer, was killed, and the loss in cannon, mortars, batteaux,
and other military resources, was great.</p>

   <img src="images/illus-227.jpg" alt="Destruction of Kittaning." title="Destruction of Kittaning."/>
   <p class="caption2">Destruction of Kittaning.</p>
</div>

<p>During this unfortunate year, a single military adventure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
on the confines of Pennsylvania, shows that the colonists
were not insensible to the Indian depredations, and to the
duty of attempting to repress them. Fort Granby, in that
state, was surprised by a party of French and Indians, who
made the garrison prisoners. Departing, in this instance,
from their usual custom of killing and scalping the captives,
they loaded them with flour, and thus drove them into the
wilderness. In another quarter, the Indians on the Ohio
barbarously killed, in their incursions, above a thousand
inhabitants of the western frontiers. To avenge this outrageous
conduct, Colonel Armstrong, with a party of two
hundred and eighty provincials, marched from Fort Shirley,
on the Juniata river, about one hundred and fifty miles west
of Philadelphia, to Kittaning, an Indian town, the rendezvous
of these murdering savages, and destroyed it. An
Indian chief, called Captain Jacobs, defended himself through
loop-holes of his log cabin. As the Indians refused the
quarter which was offered them, Colonel Armstrong gave
orders to set their houses on fire. This was at once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
executed, and many of the Indians perished by the flames
and suffocation. Numbers were shot in attempting to
reach the river. Jacobs, his squaw, and a boy called the
king's son, were fired upon as they were attempting to
escape out of the window, and were all killed and scalped.
It is computed that between thirty and forty Indians were
destroyed in this attack. Eleven English prisoners were
also released.</p>

<p>On this occasion, a Captain Mercer was wounded, and
conveyed away by his ensign and eleven men. He afterwards
returned safe with twenty-three men, and four
released prisoners. He is believed to be the distinguished
General Mercer of the United States army, who died of
wounds received in the battle of Princeton in 1776.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>The campaign of the succeeding year, 1757, is chiefly
memorable in our annals for the dreadful massacre of the
English at Fort William Henry, on the 9th of August,
and which deserves a particular recital. Fort William
Henry was commanded at this time by Colonel Monroe, a
British officer. Being vigorously pressed, and unable to
obtain assistance from General Webb, who was at Fort
Edward with the main army, and having burst many of
his guns and mortars, and expended most of his ammunition,
he had no alternative but to surrender. By the capitulation
which was signed, the troops were allowed to retain
their arms, and as a protection against the Indians, were to
receive an escort for their march to Fort Edward. Soon
after, a detachment of the French army took possession of
the fort. At the same time, the Indians, impatient for plunder
and blood, rushed over the parapets, and were ready for
operations. Colonel Monroe, perceiving their object, and
dreading to remain within the camp exposed to their
cupidity and vengeance, gave orders for marching about
midnight. Preparations accordingly were made, but it
was found that a large body of Indians was on the road<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
with a view to intercept his march. Safety, therefore, did
not permit them to leave the camp.</p>

<p>Early in the morning they began their march, but their
situation was worse now than it had been before, with the
savages threatening and prowling around them. Armed
with tomahawks or other instruments of death, they filled
the woods, and commenced their work of plunder and
butchery upon the retreating British. Monroe complained
to the French commander, and demanded the promised
escort. This was not furnished, probably, as the French
themselves feared the Indians; but the British were advised
to yield to the former their private property, as the means
of appeasing the foe, and saving life. This was very generally
done, but it produced no effect, except to increase
their rapacity. Whatever was withheld, they seized, and
many were stripped almost entirely of their clothing, and
some even to nudity. They rushed upon the sick and
wounded, whom they killed and scalped; the negroes,
mulattoes, and friendly Indians, were then dragged from
the ranks, and shared the same fate. The English troops,
under these circumstances, did as they could, until they
reached a French guard on the way. They were followed
by the insulting, robbing, and murdering savages. "The
women accompanying the troops, unable to resist, were
seized, their throats cut, their bodies ripped open, and their
bowels torn out, and thrown in their faces; the children
were taken by the heels, and their brains dashed out against
the rocks and trees; and it is stated that many of the
savages drank the heart's blood of their victims, as it
flowed reeking from the horrid wounds."</p>

<p>General Webb, on receiving intelligence of the capitulation,
ordered five hundred men to meet the captured
troops, and conduct them to his camp; but, to his surprise,
instead of meeting the escort, he found the captives
flying, through the woods singly, or in small groups, some
distracted, and many bleeding with dreadful wounds,
faint, and in a state of exhaustion. The whole number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
massacred and carried off, was probably not far from
three hundred.</p>

<p>The ill successes and losses of several campaigns now
roused the people, both in the parent-country and in the
provinces, to the consideration of more vigorous measures,
under more able men. Accordingly, William Pitt, Earl
of Chatham, the greatest statesman of modern ages, was
brought forward at the present crisis, and infused his own
ardent and decisive spirit into the national counsels. He
sympathized with his trans-Atlantic brethren, and assured
them, in a circular which he addressed to the governors of
the provinces, that an effectual force should be sent against
the French the next year, to operate both by sea and land.
In connection with such a force, they were expected to raise
their full quotas of troops, according to the number of the
inhabitants. Animated by the favorable change in the
parent-country, the government of Massachusetts voted
seven thousand men, Connecticut five thousand, and New
Hampshire three thousand, and the troops were ready for
service in the early part of the year (1758). An armament
of twelve thousand troops having been sent out from
England, commanded by General Amherst, and the British
forces already in America, added to the number of soldiers
raised by the colonies, constituted an army far greater than
had been before seen on this side of the ocean.</p>

<p>The expeditions proposed for the year were three&mdash;the
first against <i>Louisburg</i>, the second against <i>Ticonderoga</i>,
and <i>Crown Point</i>, and the third against <i>Fort Du Quesne</i>.
The feelings of resentment against the enemy were strong,
and the colonists engaged heartily in the movements; for
Canada was filled, so to speak, "with prisoners and scalps,
private plunder, and public stores and provisions, which our
people, as beasts of burden, had conveyed to them." The
enterprise against Louisburg was conducted by the land
and naval commanders, Amherst and Boscawen, with
twenty ships of the line, and fourteen thousand men. As
the British minister had in view the absolute extinction of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
the French power in America, it was of the highest importance
to take Louisburg, as a key to the possession of the
capital of Canada.</p>

<p>The armament arrived before the place on the 2d of June.
The commander of the garrison, the Chevalier de Drucourt,
was an officer of experience and courage. His force,
however, was not large, consisting of twenty-five hundred
regulars, and six hundred militia. But the harbor was so
strongly secured, that it was found necessary to land the
English forces at some distance from the town. The landing
was effected with difficulty, though with little loss. General
James Wolfe, who then commenced his distinguished military
career, was detached with two thousand men to seize
a post occupied by the enemy at the Light-house point,
from which the ships in the harbor and the fortifications
in the town might be greatly harassed. The post was
abandoned on the approach of Wolfe, and very strong
batteries were erected there. Approaches were also made
on the opposite side of the town, and the siege was urged
with skill and vigor. The cannonade kept up against the
town and the ships in the harbor was so effective, that there
seemed to be little prospect of defending the place, and the
government offered to capitulate Louisburg, with all its
artillery, (two hundred and twenty-one pieces of cannon
and eighteen mortars,) and a very large quantity of stores
and ammunition; as also the Island Royal, St. John's, and
their dependencies, were surrendered to the English. The
speedy result was also the entire possession of the island of
Cape Breton. The loss to the garrison was upwards of
fifteen hundred men&mdash;to the assailants, about four hundred
killed and wounded. In England, the trophies of the victory
were publicly exhibited, and the event was religiously
noticed in all the churches. In New England the joy
was great, and the victory there also commemorated with
public thanksgivings.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>Of the second expedition, under General Abercrombie,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
against Ticonderoga, it may suffice to say, that, notwithstanding
its strength, numbering fifteen thousand troops,
with a formidable train of artillery and the usual appliances,
it utterly failed, through the unskilfulness and rashness of
Abercrombie himself. Fort Frontenac, however, on the
return of the army from their dépôt, was besieged and
captured. The success of this last enterprise prepared
the way for the reduction of Fort Du Quesne, the third
object of the campaign of 1758. This expedition was
entrusted to General Forbes. The fort, however, was
found to have been abandoned by the French and Indians.
It was now taken possession of by the English, who named
it Pittsburg, in compliment to the British minister. Upon
this event, the Indian tribes on the Ohio submitted to the
English. The gloom which spread over the colonies by
the defeat at Ticonderoga, was, in a measure, dissipated by
the successes of Amherst and Forbes.</p>

<p>For the campaign of 1759, three expeditions were proposed&mdash;one
against <i>Ticonderoga</i> and <i>Crown Point</i>, to be
conducted by Amherst&mdash;a second against <i>Niagara</i>, under
Prideaux&mdash;and a third against <i>Quebec</i>, to be conducted by
General Wolfe.</p>

<p>On the 22d of July, Amherst, in accordance with the
above plan, invested <i>Ticonderoga</i> with twelve thousand
provincials and regulars, and soon succeeded in capturing
that important fortress. Following this, the village of St.
Francis, situated at the mouth of the river of that name
was destroyed.</p>

   <p class="caption2">Destruction of the village of St. Francis.</p>
</div>

<p>It had been the resort of Indian robbers and murderers,
where were deposited the scalps and plundered goods
of hundreds of hapless Englishmen. It was taken and
destroyed by a party under Major Rogers, after a series of
adventures and hair-breadth escapes, which have more the
appearance of romance than reality. There was a general
conflagration of the cabins, and out of three hundred inhabitants,
two hundred were killed, twenty women and children
captured, and five English prisoners in the village set free.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

<p>The army destined against <i>Niagara</i>, was composed
principally of provincials, rëinforced by a strong body of
friendly Indians. It was placed under the command of
General Prideaux, who commenced the siege of the place
on the 6th of July. While directing the operations of the
place, he was killed by the bursting of a shell. The command
of the army then fell upon Sir William Johnson, who
prosecuted the enterprise with judgment and vigor. The
French, alarmed at the prospect of losing a post which
formed the communication between Canada and Louisiana,
in the mean while, made a strenuous effort to raise the
siege, by collecting a large body of troops from several
neighboring garrisons. These were brought, on the morning
of the 24th, in battle array against the besiegers, ushered
in by the horrible sound of the Indian war-whoop. The
French charged with great impetuosity, but the English
maintained their ground, and eventually repulsed them with
signal slaughter. The fate of Niagara was now decided.
The next day a capitulation was signed, and this portion
of the country fell into the hands of the English.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>

<p>The grand enterprise for the reduction of <i>Quebec</i> was
entrusted, as already noticed, to the gallant and accomplished
Wolfe, who sailed from Halifax early in the season, and near
the last of June landed the whole army on the island of
Orleans, a few miles below Quebec. Here the sight presented
to him of the formidable position and works of the
enemy by no means served to encourage expectations of
success. But his resolution and desire of victory overcame
every other sentiment.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="illus-234.jpg" id="illus-234.jpg"></a>
   <img src="images/illus-234.jpg" alt="Quebec." title="Quebec."/>
   <p class="caption2">Quebec.</p>
</div>

<p>"The city of Quebec rose before him upon the north side
of the St. Lawrence; its upper town and strong fortifications
situated on a rock, whose bold and steep front continued
far westward parallel with the river, its base near
the shore; thus presenting a wall which it seemed impossible
to scale. From the north-west came down the St.
Charles, entering the St. Lawrence just below the town,
its banks high and uneven, and cut by deep ravines; while
armed vessels were borne upon its waters, and floating
batteries obstructed its entrance. A few miles below, the
Montmorenci leaped down the cataract into the St. Lawrence;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
and strongly posted along the sloping banks of that
river, and between these two tributaries, the French army,
commanded by Montcalm, displayed its formidable lines."</p>

<p>We necessarily pass over several ineffectual attempts of
Wolfe to draw Montcalm from his strong intrenchments into
a general engagement, during which, and in consequence
of excitement under their repeated failure, he fell sick.
When, however, he had so far recovered as to assume the
command, a plan was proposed to him by his generals for
getting possession of the heights in the rear of the city,
where it was but slightly fortified. Could the steep
acclivity of rocks be surmounted, they would be able to
reach the level plain above, called the Heights of Abraham.
The plan was altogether congenial to the feelings of the
commander-in-chief, and was put into execution with judgment
and vigor.</p>

<p>In pursuance of this plan, Wolfe broke up his camp at
Montmorenci, near the falls of that name, and returned to
the island of Orleans, where he first disembarked. From
that spot he determined to push his daring enterprise.
Embarking himself and army on board of the fleet, he
directed Admiral Holmes to sail up the river several miles
higher than the intended point of debarkation, making
occasional demonstrations of a design to land troops.
That being accomplished, during the night a strong detachment
in flat-bottomed boats fell down with the tide, to a
point about a mile above the city. The shelving beach, the
high precipitous banks, and the only path by which the place
could be scaled, being defended by a captain's guard and
a battery of four guns, all rendered the landing and ascent
of the heights, on the part of the English, a work of amazing
difficulty; yet it was effected, Wolfe himself being one of
the first who leaped on shore.</p>

<p>The whole plan had well nigh been defeated at the water's
edge, for one of the sentinels hailed. But being answered
by a captain in Frazier's regiment, who fully understood
the French language, and had been expressly instructed for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
the purpose, the latter was suffered to pass. The sentinel,
from the answers given, (for the English were twice interrogated,)
concluded at once that this was a French convoy
of provisions, which was expected to pass down the river
to Quebec. This the English had learned from some
deserters. Escaping this difficulty, they commenced their
arduous and perilous task. The Highlanders and light
infantry, under the command of General Howe, led the
way up the fearful precipice, which was one hundred and
fifty or two hundred feet high, an almost perpendicular
ascent. They clambered up by the aid of the projection
of rocks, and the limbs of trees and shrubs growing on the
cliffs. They first drove away the guard, and seized the
battery. The rest of the troops pressed on in the difficult
and confined path, and, by day-break, the whole army was
planted firmly on the plains of Abraham.</p>

<p>Montcalm, taken by surprise at this unexpected scaling
of the heights, was forced to abandon his strong position,
and come to an engagement. For this purpose, he crossed
the St. Charles, and drew up his army in battle array. This
being perceived by Wolfe, a corresponding movement was
made on the part of the English, and the disposition of the
troops was such as to meet the masterly arrangements of
Montcalm. The battle was commenced by the French, a
portion of whose army, consisting of fifteen hundred Indians
and Canadians, who were excellent marksmen, advanced in
front for this purpose. Screened by surrounding thickets,
they aimed with fatal effect at many of the British officers,
but this lasted only a short time. The main body of the
French now advancing, the principal struggle came on in
all its fury. The English, reserving their fire until within
forty yards of the enemy's line, then made terrible havoc
among them by a general discharge. This fire was vigorously
maintained until the French yielded to it. General
Wolfe exposed himself in front of his battalion, as also
did Montcalm before his, and both officers paid the price
of their bravery. They were in the sections of the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
armies, where the battle was most severe, and both fell
mortally wounded, not far from the same time. There
was another striking coincidence&mdash;they who succeeded
them in command in either army, also fell wounded&mdash;the
Frenchman mortally. When Wolfe fell, he was pressing
on at the head of his grenadiers with fixed bayonets. It
was the third time that he had received a wound; a ball
had now pierced his breast. The respective armies continued
in their strife, as if nothing had happened. After
Wolfe and Monckton had been laid aside, Townsend
assumed the command, and the British grenadiers pressed
on with their bayonets. The center of the French army
was soon broken by the brisk advance of General Murray.
The Highlanders with their broad-swords completed the
confusion of the enemy, driving them with great slaughter
in different directions. A portion of the French army fled
into Quebec. The enemy was signally defeated, having
lost a thousand men, besides an equal number of prisoners.
The loss of the English, in killed and wounded, was less
than six hundred.</p>

<p>The necessary preparations were now made by Townsend
for the siege of the city; but at the expiration of five days,
it was surrendered to the English fleet and army. The
capital of Canada, at the time of its capitulation, contained
about ten thousand inhabitants, and thus having passed
under the dominion of Great Britain, was protected by a
garrison of five thousand men, under the command of
General Murray.</p>

<p>Wolfe died of his wounds on the field of battle. He
manifested "the ruling passion strong in death." As a
touching incident in the annals of warfare, scarcely any
thing can equal it, unless it may be that which also marked
the death of his opponent. He was removed into the rear
almost against his consent, that he might be attended to; but
while others were expressing their sympathy in his behalf,
he was watching the terrific contest with intense anxiety.
At length, he could no longer sustain himself, but, faint with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
the loss of blood, he leaned on the shoulder of an officer,
who kneeled down to support him. The agony of death
was now upon him. A cry was heard, "They fly, they fly!"
"Who fly?" asked the expiring hero. "The French!"
replied his supporter. "Then I die happy!" he said.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="illus-238.jpg" id="illus-238.jpg"></a>
   <img src="images/illus-238.jpg" alt="Death of Wolfe." title="Death of Wolfe."/>
   <p class="caption2">Death of Wolfe.</p>
</div>

<p>Montcalm, too, died in a few hours after, having been
first conveyed into the city. On being told that his wound
was mortal, he expressed his satisfaction at the fact. When
further informed that he could survive but a few hours, he
replied, "So much the better: I shall not live to see the surrender
of Quebec."</p>

<p>The French continued in possession of Canada for a time,
notwithstanding the capture of Quebec. Indeed, a second,
and more mortal struggle, was soon to be again witnessed on
the Heights of Abraham. The main body of the French
army, which, after its defeat, retired to Montreal, and which
was still formidable, had been rëinforced by six thousand
Canadian militia and a body of Indians. With these forces,
M. de Levi, the successor of Montcalm, appeared before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
Quebec, with the design of besieging the fortress. Murray,
whose force had been reduced by the severities of the
winter, the want of proper food, from five thousand to three
thousand, left his works, and met the French near Sillery,
and a severe action took place, in which the advantage was
on the side of the French, the English being obliged to
retire within the fortress. The loss on both sides was very
great, being nearly one thousand each; but the battle was
productive of no special results. Levi found it impossible
to reduce the place; and the English, receiving rëinforcements
after being closely invested for a time, it was concluded
by the French commander to abandon the project,
and he accordingly returned to Montreal.</p>

<p>As it seemed necessary to try the fortune of another
campaign against the enemy, since, notwithstanding the
capture of the French posts in 1759, the province still held
out against the British arms, General Amherst had made
arrangements for assembling before Montreal all the British
troops from Lake Ontario, Lake Champlain, and Quebec.
The several armies were early in motion, and so accurately
had their operations been concerted, that Amherst and
Murray reached the vicinity of Montreal on the same day;
when Haviland, who commanded a small force from Crown
Point, joined them: the next day, Vaudreuil, the governor,
finding further resistance vain, demanded a capitulation;
and on the 18th of September, 1760, the whole French
possessions in Canada, were surrendered to the British
power.</p>

<p>The war still continued in Europe, and a few provincial
troops were raised in 1761 and 1762; but New England
remained exempted from all border hostilities. On the 10th
of February, 1763, a general peace was signed at Paris,
and soon after ratified by Great Britain and France. This
was an era of joy to the colonies. They had experienced
no such relief since the commencement of King William's
War, in 1689. A few short intervals of peace had indeed
been enjoyed, but during nearly eighty years, they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
generally doomed in every exposed point to pillage, captivity,
and slaughter. Relieved from their miseries and
dangers, they reoccupied their plantations, and new ones
were commenced, and population began to spread with
rapidity.</p>

<p>It may be added, and it is due to the colonist to add, that
they were not unmindful of their obligations to that Being
by whose fostering care they had been preserved during so
many and so severe trials and privations. They had put
their trust in Him, and he had saved them from the hands
of their foes. Many had indeed fallen&mdash;many had suffered;
but now, relieved from foreign invasion and savage butchery,
they united in giving God thanks on a day set apart
for the purpose, and went on their way rejoicing.</p>

<p>The Revolution of America was an extraordinary event;
and at the time of its occurrence was unlooked for, both
by the government and nation of Great Britain. That the
colonies had long been dissatisfied with the measures adopted
towards them by the parent-country, and that this dissatisfaction
was gradually increasing, was well known; but the
statesmen on the other side designed, and doubtless supposed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
that they should be able to secure the submission of the colonies
to whatever line of policy they might please to adopt.</p>

<p>But they little understood the American character. Had
they reflected upon the circumstances in which the colonies
originated, and their steady progress in wealth and population,
they might well have anticipated the final result.
Certain it was, that oppressive and coercive measures would
only tend to weaken their affection for the parent-country.
Kindness and conciliation might have preserved the bond
of union&mdash;indeed, it was possible to have confirmed the
colonies in their regard for the land of their birth; but the
line of policy which could alone have effected that object,
was overlooked or disregarded by British statesmen; and
through their infatuated counsels, they hastened the very
event which they so much deplored.</p>

<p>Let us advert to some of the remote and proximate
causes, which brought about this Revolution:</p>

<p>1. Objects proposed by the colonies in their settlement
of America.&mdash;</p>

<p>At the era of the Revolution, thirteen colonies had been
planted. These were Virginia, Massachusetts, New Hampshire,
Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey,
Delaware, Pennsylvania, Maryland, North and South Carolina,
and Georgia. Virginia, the first, was settled in 1607, and
Georgia, the last, in 1732. Different objects were proposed
in the establishment of the different colonies. The leading
object of some was pecuniary profit. They were induced,
either by associated or individual proprietors, who themselves
remained in England, to come to America, with the
hope of profitable returns for the advance of their capital.
But the more northern colonies came on their own concern,
at their own expense, and with reference to the enjoyment
of freedom and peace in religion, which they could not find
at home.</p>

<p>Now, was it to be expected that those who had left home,
and all its endearments, for the sake of enjoying a larger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
liberty, would consent to have that liberty abridged,
especially after having tasted its blessings for years? If
the Pilgrim Fathers had such notions themselves, was it to
be supposed that their children would cherish less manly
and patriotic sentiments? The spirit of liberty does not
easily die, where there is aliment to keep it alive. The
blood of freemen, or those who aspire to freedom, instead
of becoming weaker, as it flows down in successive generations,
usually becomes more pure and more excitable.
This was verified in the history of the colonies, anterior to
the Revolution. They were men of whom the principles
of liberty had taken strong hold. Their distance from the
mother-country&mdash;her neglect of them&mdash;the exercise of
civil and religious freedom for a number of years&mdash;all
served to excite and strengthen a desire for independence.
Such an event was the natural result of the principles with
which the colonies began their career. It was the natural
result of the physical courage and strength acquired in
felling forests, resisting savages, and in carrying out those
plans and enterprises in which a young, ardent, and ambitious
people are likely to engage.</p>

<p>2. Their forms of government were conducive to independence.</p>

<p>In the settlement of the colonies, three forms of government
were established. These were usually denominated
Charter, Proprietary, and Royal governments. The difference
arose from the different circumstances under which
the colonies were settled, as well as the different objects of
the first emigrants. The Charter governments were confined
to New England. The Proprietary governments
were those of Maryland, Pennsylvania, the Carolinas, and
the Jerseys. The others were royal governments, or those
which were immediately under the British crown.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>As early as 1619, only twelve years from its settlement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
a provincial legislature, in which the colonists were represented,
was introduced into Virginia. In Plymouth and in
Massachusetts, the colonies organized their body, politic
and social, upon principles of perfect equality. And, as the
Puritans spread themselves over New England, they gave
to the distinct communities which they established, constitutions
still more democratic. In January, 1639, three years
from the commencement of the Connecticut colony, the
planters on Connecticut river convened at Hartford, and
formed a system of government which continued, with
scarcely any alterations, to the year 1818. Of this system,
Dr. Trumbull observes: "With such wisdom did our venerable
ancestors provide for the freedom and liberties of themselves
and their posterity. Thus happily did they guard
against every encroachment on the rights of the subject.
This, probably, is one of the most free and happy constitutions
of civil government ever formed. The formation of
it, at so early a period, when the light of liberty was
wholly darkened in most parts of the world, and the rights
of man were so little understood in others, does great honor
to their ability, integrity, and love of freedom."</p>

<p>In Maryland and Pennsylvania, the first assemblies established
a popular representation, and in all their political
regulations proceeded upon broad views of civil freedom.
The same remark, says Mr. Walsh, may be extended to
the Carolinas and New York.</p>

<p>The very first principles, then, of the colonists in relation
to government were anti-monarchical. In their incipient
colonial state, they had the feelings of freemen; and all
their institutions, as far as they were allowed to carry
them, spoke of liberty and equality.</p>

<p>This spirit was never lost to the colonies. In the variety
of fortune which they subsequently encountered&mdash;in every
change of monarch abroad&mdash;in every shift of rulers at
home&mdash;through royal smiles and royal frowns&mdash;in times of
war and in times of peace&mdash;their love of liberty continued
unabated, and even increased. Thus early began those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
sentiments of freedom and independence which, uniting in
their course with other streams, ended at length in a deep,
broad, irresistible current against British oppression.</p>

<p>3. Influence of the expenses incurred by the colonies in
their settlements, and in their several wars and those of
the mother-country.</p>

<p>"All the thirteen colonies," says Mr. Walsh, "with the
exception of Georgia, were established, and had attained
to considerable strength, without the <i>slightest aid</i> from the
treasury of the mother-country."</p>

<p>Neither the crown nor the parliament paid a dollar
towards purchasing the soil of the Indians&mdash;the original
masters of that soil. These purchases were made by the
colonists themselves. The settlement of the province of
Massachusetts Bay alone cost two hundred thousand pounds&mdash;an
enormous sum at the era at which it was effected.
Lord Baltimore expended forty thousand pounds in his
establishment of the colony of Maryland. On that of
Virginia, immense wealth was lavished by the first settlers.
The first planters of Connecticut consumed great
estates in purchasing lands of the Indians and in making
settlements.</p>

<p>In like manner, when assailed by fierce and warlike
tribes, the mother-country furnished no aid whatever&mdash;neither
troops nor money. She erected no fortifications;
entered into no negotiations, and manifested no sympathy,
or even interest, in the fate of her offspring. Some of the
most considerable Indian wars in which the colonies were
involved, were the immediate result of the rashness and
cupidity of the royal governors. That, for instance, which
is styled 'King William's War'&mdash;memorable in the annals
of New Hampshire particularly&mdash;was owing to a wanton
predatory expedition of Andros, in 1688, against the possessions
of a French individual, situate between Penobscot
and Nova Scotia.</p>

<p>The testimony of Lord Brougham on this subject is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
worthy of special notice. In his work on 'Colonial Policy,'
he observes:</p>

<p>"The old colonies of North America, besides defraying
the whole expenses of their internal administration, were
enabled from their situation to render very active assistance
to the mother-country upon several occasions, not peculiarly
interesting to themselves. They uniformly asserted, that
they <i>would</i> never refuse contributions, even for purposes
strictly imperial, provided these were constitutionally demanded.
Nor did they stop at mere professions of zeal.</p>

<p>"The whole expense of civil government in the British
North American colonies, previous to the Revolution, did
not amount to eighty thousand pounds sterling, which was
paid by the produce of their taxes. The military establishments,
the garrisons and the forts in the old colonies, cost
the mother-country nothing."</p>

<p>From the foregoing facts, nothing is clearer than that
the colonies were obliged, from their earliest existence, to
take care of themselves. At first, Great Britain thought
little of them, and cared, if possible, still less. They were
obliged to repel hostile tribes without aid, and defend themselves
against the aggressions of more civilized powers.
And, moreover, they were compelled to carry on not only
their own wars, but those of the mother-country, and then
pay the expenses.</p>

<p>It may well be asked, what was the natural and almost
necessary consequence of such treatment? Keep a child
in leading-strings, and it will be long ere it walks. Teach
him to walk early, and he will soon decline your aid. Let
a father send forth his son to take care of himself, and
perchance the next he hears of him, he will learn that his
fortune is made, and no longer will he wish for parental
assistance; and fortunate will it be if the son, under a sense
of former parental indifference and unkindness, does not, at
length, feel a correspondent alienation from the parent.</p>

<p>But whether these illustrations are apposite or not, certain
it is, that the colonists at length learned the important fact,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
that they could take care of themselves. To this they had
been driven. The next natural feeling to this superiority
over the difficulties and trials which they encountered in
their early settlement of the country, was a willingness,
and even <i>wish</i>, to be independent of the parent by whom
they had been so unkindly neglected. Great Britain might,
therefore, thank herself for the spirit of independence which
at length appeared among the colonies; her line of policy
engendered and matured it.</p>

<p>4. Measures of oppression.</p>

<p>"Within little more than a generation from the commencement
of the plantations," says Mr. Walsh, "the royal
government began those formal inquiries into their population
and manufactures, which were so often renewed, until
the period of our revolution." The object or occasion of
these inquiries was twofold&mdash;a jealousy, lest the colonies
should grow too fast; and, secondly, a desire to monopolize,
for the benefit of Great Britain, all their trade, and the proceeds
of their manufacturing industry.</p>

<p>The various acts of monopoly which passed parliament
during a series of years, it is not necessary to particularize.
They uniformly bore heavily on the commercial and manufacturing
enterprise of the colonies, and were designed "to
keep them in a firmer dependence upon England"&mdash;"to
render them more beneficial and advantageous"&mdash;"to employ
and increase the English shipping"&mdash;"to make a vent
for English manufactures."</p>

<p>After the peace of 1763, a still more grinding policy was
proposed&mdash;that of <i>taxing</i> the colonies, with the avowed
purpose of drawing a revenue into the royal exchequer,
and on the plausible, yet unwarrantable ground, that Great
Britain had contracted a debt in their defence.</p>

<p>Hitherto, when money was wanted in the colonies, the
parliament of England had been content to ask for it by a
formal requisition upon the <i>colonial legislatures</i>, and they
had supplied it with a willing hand. But now, it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
thought that a shorter method of obtaining it might be
resorted to with better effect.</p>

<p>Before proceeding to notice the measures adopted with
reference to the foregoing object, it is necessary to advert
to what were denominated <i>writs of assistance</i>, which were
orders issued by the superior court of the province, requiring
the sheriffs and other civil officers to assist the person
to whom it was granted, in breaking open and searching
every place, even private dwellings, if suspected of containing
prohibited goods.</p>

<p>The first application for a writ of this kind was made by
the deputy collector at Salem in November, 1760. Doubts
being expressed by the court as to the legality of the writ,
or the power of the court to grant it, the application was
deferred to the next term, when the question was to be
argued.</p>

<p>At the appointed time, Mr. Gridley, a distinguished lawyer,
appeared for the crown; Mr. Thatcher and Mr. Otis
for the merchants. The trial took place in the council
chamber of the old Town-house in Boston. The judges
were five in number, including Lieutenant-Governor Hutchinson,
who presided as chief justice; and the room was
filled with all the officers of government and the principal
citizens, to hear the arguments in a cause that inspired the
deepest solicitude. The case was opened by Mr. Gridley,
who argued it with much learning, ingenuity, and dignity;
making all his reason depend upon this consideration, "That
the parliament of Great Britain was the sovereign legislator
of the British empire." He was followed by Mr. Thatcher
on the opposite side, whose reasoning was ingenious and
able, delivered in a tone of great mildness and moderation.
"But," in the language of President Adams, "Otis was a
flame of fire; with a promptitude of classical allusion, a
depth of research, a rapid summary of historical events
and dates, a profusion of legal authorities, a prophetic
glance into futurity, and a rapid torrent of impetuous eloquence,
he hurried away all before him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will to my dying day," said Otis, among other things&mdash;"I
will to my dying day oppose, with all the power and
faculties God has given me, all such instruments of slavery
on the one hand and villany on the other. It appears to
me the worst instrument of arbitrary power, the most
destructive of English liberty, and the fundamental principles
of law, that was ever found in an English law-book."</p>

   <img src="images/illus-249.jpg" alt="Otis in the Council chamber." title="Otis in the Council chamber."/>
   <p class="caption2">Otis in the Council chamber.</p>
</div>

<p>The occasion was intensely exciting&mdash;the liberties of the
people were in danger&mdash;their dwellings, those sanctuaries
where every man should feel himself safe, and his effects&mdash;all
were in jeopardy. And the vast throng gathered on
the occasion so thought&mdash;especially as their excited feelings
became more intense under the thrilling appeals of the
eloquent Otis. "Every man of an immensely crowded
audience," says President Adams, "appeared to me to go
away, as I did, ready to take arms against writs of assistance.
<i>Then and there was the first scene of the first act
of opposition to the arbitrary claims of Great Britain.</i>"</p>

<p>The court postponed a decision of the question until the
following term; and in the mean time wrote to Great Britain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
for information on the subject. Writs were afterwards
granted, but were extremely unpopular. In Connecticut
writs of assistance, it is said, were never granted.</p>

<p>The next measure of oppression was the passage of the
famous <i>stamp act</i>. Such a project had been suggested
during the administrations of Lord Walpole and Mr. Pitt;
but they were too sagacious to venture upon a measure at
once so odious and unjust. Said Walpole, "I will leave
the taxation of America to some of my successors, who
may have more <i>courage</i> than I have." And said Pitt, "I
will never burn my fingers with an American stamp act."
To the successor of Mr. Pitt, Lord Grenville, was reserved
the honor, or rather the infamy, of such a project.</p>

<p>When the bill was ushered into the House of Commons,
petitions from Virginia, Connecticut, and South Carolina, in
every way respectful, but in tone firm and decided, were
offered in opposition to it. But the house refused even to
receive them, on the ground that the <i>right</i> of parliament to
tax the colonies was denied; and, secondly, that it was
contrary to a rule of the house "<i>to receive any petition
against a money-bill</i>."</p>

<p>The debate therefore proceeded. The chief advocates
of the bill were the prime minister and Charles Townshend.
In the opposition were Mr. Pitt&mdash;who, however, was absent
by reason of sickness&mdash;General Conway, Alderman Beckford,
Colonel Barre, Mr. Jackson, Sir William Meredith,
&amp;c. Conway and Beckford opposed the bill on the ground
of its <i>injustice</i>; Colonel Barre and others on the ground of
its <i>inexpediency</i>. The purpose of the minister, however,
was fixed; and, rallying his surprised and half-hesitating
troops, he took the question&mdash;a large majority expressed in
favor of the bill&mdash;two hundred and fifty for, and fifty against
it. On its coming into the House of Lords, it received the
entire concurrence of that body, and on the 22d of March
obtained the royal assent.</p>

<p>This act, so celebrated in the annals of American history,
both as an act of flagrant injustice, on the part of the British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
parliament, and one of the <i>proximate causes</i> of the Revolution,
consisted of fifty-five specific duties, laid on as many
different species of instruments, in which paper was used;
such as notes, bonds, mortgages, deeds, university degrees,
licenses, advertisements in newspapers, and even almanacs;
varying from <i>one half-penny</i> up to <i>six pounds</i>. As an
illustration of the heavy burdens designed to be put upon
the colonies by this act, it may be stated, that previous to
the passage of the act, a ream of common printed bailbonds
cost fifteen pounds&mdash;<i>stamped</i>, one hundred. A ream of
<i>stamped</i> policies of insurance amounted to one hundred and
ninety pounds&mdash;of common ones, without stamps, twenty.
A piece of paper, or parchment, used as a diploma, or certificate
of a degree taken in any university, academy, or
college, was taxed <i>two pounds</i>. For a piece of paper for a
license for retailing spirituous liquors, <i>twenty shillings</i> were
demanded. For one for a license for selling wine only,
<i>four pounds</i>; for wine and spirituous liquors, <i>three pounds</i>.
For letters of probate, administration, or guardianship, <i>ten
shillings</i>. For a common deed, conveying not exceeding
one hundred acres of land, <i>one shilling and sixpence</i>. For
a newspaper, containing half a sheet or less, <i>one half-penny</i>;
one sheet, <i>one penny</i>. Pamphlets, <i>one shilling</i> per sheet.
Advertisements, <i>two shillings</i> each. Almanacs, <i>fourpence</i>.</p>

<p>This act was ordered to take effect on the following 1st
of November. Meanwhile, the people in various parts of
the country were anxious to express their detestation of the
measure, which the lapse of a few months was to bring into
operation. One day in the month of August, the effigy of
Andrew Oliver, the proposed distributor of stamps in Massachusetts,
was found hanging on a tree, afterwards well
known by the name of <i>Liberty-tree</i>, in the main street of
Boston. At night it was taken down, and carried on a bier
amidst the acclamations of an immense collection of people
through the court-house, down King street, to a small brick
building, supposed to have been erected for the reception
of the detested stamps. This building being soon levelled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
with the ground, the rioters next attacked Mr. Oliver's
house; and having broken the windows, entered it, and
destroyed part of the furniture.</p>

   <p class="caption2">Procession with an Effigy and Stamp-master at Boston.</p>
</div>

<p>The house of Benjamin Hallowell, jun., comptroller of
the customs, was next entered; and, elevated and emboldened
by liquors found in his cellar, the mob, with inflamed
rage, directed their course to the house of Lieutenant-Governor
Hutchinson, who, after vainly attempting resistance,
was constrained to depart, to save his life. By four in the
morning, one of the best houses in the province was completely
in ruins, nothing remaining but the bare walls and
floors. The plate, family pictures, most of the furniture,
the wearing apparel, about nine hundred pounds sterling,
and the manuscripts and books which Mr. Hutchinson had
been thirty years collecting, besides many public papers in
his custody, were either carried off or destroyed. The
whole damage was estimated at two thousand five hundred
pounds.</p>

   <p class="caption2">Attack, on the Governor's House.</p>
</div>

<p>On the arrival of the 1st of November, on which the
stamp act was to go into effect, the day was ushered in at
Boston by the tolling of the bells; many shops and stores
were shut, and effigies of the authors and friends of that act
were carried about the streets, and afterwards torn in pieces
by the populace.</p>

<p>Nor was Massachusetts alone; the obnoxious act received
similar treatment in the other colonies. On the 24th of
August, a gazette was published at Providence, with <i>vox
Populi, vox Dei</i>, for a motto; effigies were exhibited, and
in the evening cut down and burned. In Portsmouth, New
Castle, and other places, the bells were tolled to denote the
decease of Liberty. In Connecticut, Mr. Ingersoll, the
stamp-master, was compelled to resign. The spirit manifested
in New York produced a similar resignation.
Offended with the conduct of Lieutenant-Governor Colden,
in relation to the stamp act, many of the inhabitants assembled
one evening, and breaking open his coach-house, took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
out his coach, which, with his effigy, they burned, amid the
acclamations of several thousand spectators.</p>

   <p class="caption2">Burning of the Coach and Effigy of Governor Colden.</p>
</div>

<p>In Philadelphia, on the appearance of the ships having
the stamps on board, all the ships in the harbor hoisted
their colors half-mast high; the bells were muffled, and
continued to toll till evening. Similar demonstrations of
dissatisfaction were made in numerous other places.</p>

<p>The opposition to the stamp act was so universal and so
formidable, as to prevent all hope of its successful operation;
had this measure been persisted in, the Revolution
in America would doubtless have dated at an earlier day.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the American colonies, the administration
of Lord Grenville terminated in July, 1765&mdash;that minister
being succeeded by the Marquis of Rockingham, while the
Duke of Grafton and General Conway were made secretaries
of state.</p>

<p>To this new ministry it early became apparent that, in
respect to the colonies, a crisis was now at hand; either
existing measures must be relaxed, or a resort must be had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
to arms. The former being deemed the wiser plan, a
repeal of the stamp act was moved in parliament, and, on
the 18th of March, passed the House by a majority of two
hundred and seventy-five to one hundred and sixty-seven.
In the House of Lords, the majority was one hundred and
five to seventy-one.</p>

<p>In America, the intelligence of the repeal was received
with acclamations of the most sincere and heart-felt gratitude,
by all classes of people. Public thanksgivings were
offered up in all the churches. The resolutions, which had
been passed on the subject of importations, were rescinded,
and their trade with the mother-country was immediately
renewed with increased vigor. The home-spun dresses
were given to the poor, and once more the colonists
appeared clad in the produce of British looms.</p>

<p>In July, 1766, the Marquis of Rockingham retired from
the cabinet, and a new ministry was formed under the
direction of William Pitt&mdash;the Duke of Grafton being
placed at the head of the treasury, and Charles Townshend
made chancellor of the exchequer. In May, 1767, the
latter revived the scheme of taxing America, proposing to
impose duties on glass, paper, tea, &amp;c., imported into the colonies.
The bill passed both houses without much opposition,
the Earl of Chatham being confined at that time by sickness.</p>

<p>The news of this measure, on reaching America, produced
the greatest possible excitement. Counter-measures were
immediately proposed. Resort was had, as at a former
day, to non-importation, the effects of which had been so
severely felt by the traders in England, under the stamp
act. Boston, as before, took the lead. At a town-meeting,
held in October, it was voted that measures should be
immediately taken to promote the establishment of domestic
manufactories, by encouraging the consumption of all articles
of American manufacture. They also agreed to purchase
no articles of foreign growth or manufacture, but
such as were absolutely indispensable. New York and
Philadelphia soon followed the example of Boston; and, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
a short time, the merchants themselves entered into associations
to import nothing from Great Britain but articles
that necessity required.</p>

<p>Several events, about this time, served to increase the
excitement of the colonies, especially in Boston. Among
these may be mentioned the arrival, at the latter place, of a
man-of-war and transports, from Halifax, with nine hundred
troops on board.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="illus-256.jpg" id="illus-256.jpg"></a>
   <img src="images/illus-256.jpg" alt="Arrival of the first Man-of-war at Boston." title="Arrival of the first Man-of-war at Boston."/>
   <p class="caption2">Arrival of the first Man-of-war at Boston.</p>
</div>

<p>Such a proceeding, on the part of the British ministry,
was eminently calculated to excite the jealousy and indignation
of the colonists. They felt disgusted and injured;
and the more so, from the haughty and imperious bearing
of the officers and troops. In a few weeks, this force was
augmented by the arrival of several more transports from
Cork, with the sixty-fourth and sixty-fifth regiments, under
Colonels Mackay and Pomeroy.</p>

<p>Another measure, adopted about this time by the British
ministry, and one which perhaps struck more vitally at the
liberty of the colonists than any which preceded, was an
order to the provincial governors to procure information<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
touching all treasons, &amp;c., and to transmit the same, with
the names of the suspected persons, to England, in order
that they might be ordered thither for trial. The design
of it was to terrify the patriotic party into submission; but
well might it have been foreseen that such an offensive
measure would only serve to rouse opposition, and confirm
the whole civilized world in the righteousness of the common
cause.</p>

<p>Parliament again convened, January 9, 1770, soon after
which (28th) the Duke of Grafton resigned his office of first
lord of the treasury. Lord Chatham, having recovered
from his late illness, had now returned to parliament, and,
with his wonted vigor, attacked the system and measures of
the administration.</p>

<p>Lord North, chancellor of the exchequer, succeeded the
Duke of Grafton; "and from this time commences an
administration which forms a momentous era in the history
of Great Britain. During his administration, which lasted
to the close of the Revolution, Great Britain lost more territory
and accumulated more debt than at any former
period of her history."</p>

<p>The first measure of North's administration was in part
conciliatory&mdash;being a motion to repeal the port duties of
1767, with the exception of the duty on tea. This his
lordship, in spite of the friends of the colonies, determined
to retain.</p>

<p>To this partial repeal, Governor Pownall strongly
objected. It would produce nothing but civil discord and
interminable contention. Repeal all, or none. Why retain
this single duty, as a pepper-corn rent, to show the tenor
by which the colonists hold their rights, and, by so doing,
jeopardize his majesty's entire interest in the American
colonies? "I have lived in America," said he; "I know the
character of the people. Depend upon it, with their views,
they will never solicit the favor of this house; never more
will they wish to bring before parliament the grievances
under which they conceive themselves to labor."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>

<p>While high and angry debate was thus in progress on the
other side of the water, on this side, events were transpiring
which were giving increasing irritation to already excited
feelings, and adding to the force of the gathering storm.
Collisions and quarrels, between the soldiers quartered in
Boston and the citizens, were not unfrequent; and at length,
on the evening of the 5th of March, 1770, resulted in an
effusion of blood, called, by way of eminence, "The Boston
Massacre."</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

   <img src="images/illus-258.jpg" alt="Boston Massacre." title="Boston Massacre."/>
   <p class="caption2">Boston Massacre.</p>
</div>

<p>Three men were killed and two mortally wounded, who
died soon after. Mutual exasperations preceded. Neither
citizens nor soldiers were exempt from the charge of insult
and provocation. But a sentinel, who had been brought to
the ground by a blow, on rising, fired, as did, at the same
time, a sergeant and six men who were with him. Their
fire resulted as already stated. Great excitement followed.
The murderers were arrested. Captain Preston, to whose
company the soldiers belonged, and who was present, was
also arrested, and committed to prison.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>

<p>The following morning the authorities of Boston, urged
on by an exasperated people, required the troops to be withdrawn
from the town. The lieutenant-governor, for a time,
resisted the demand; but on learning that no other course
would satisfy or restrain the people, he expressed his
willingness that they should be withdrawn to the castle,
which was accordingly done.</p>

<p>The funeral of the victims was attended with extraordinary
pomp. Most of the shops were closed, all the bells
of the town tolled on the occasion, and the corpses were
followed to the grave by an immense concourse of people,
arranged six abreast, the procession being closed by a long
train of carriages, belonging to the principal gentry of the
town. Captain Preston and the party of soldiers were
afterwards tried. The captain and six of the men were
acquitted, and two were brought in guilty of manslaughter;
a result which reflected great honor on John Adams and
Josiah Quincy, the counsel for the prisoners, and on the jury.</p>

<p>The month of June, '72, furnished a new source of disquietude
and animosity. On the 9th of that month, the
Providence packet, while sailing into the harbor of Newport,
was required, by his majesty's revenue-cutter, the
Gaspee, Lieutenant Doddington, to lower her colors. This
the captain of the packet deemed repugnant to his patriotic
feelings, and the Gaspee fired at the packet, to bring her to;
the American, however, still persisted in holding on her
course, and, by keeping in shoal water, dexterously contrived
to run the schooner aground in the chase. As the
tide was upon the ebb, the Gaspee was set fast for the
night, and afforded a tempting opportunity for retaliation;
and a number of fishermen, aided and encouraged by some
of the most respectable inhabitants of Providence, being
determined to rid themselves of so uncivil an inspector,
in the middle of the night manned several boats, and
boarded the Gaspee. The lieutenant was wounded in the
affray; but, with every thing belonging to him, he was
carefully conveyed on shore, as were all his crew. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
vessel, with her stores, was then burned; and the party
returned unmolested to their homes. When the governor
became acquainted with this event, he offered a reward of
five hundred pounds for the discovery of the offenders.</p>

   <p class="caption2">Burning of the Gaspee.</p>
</div>

<p>Another fruitful source of mutual ill-feeling between the
British ministry and the colonists was the determination of
the former to introduce <i>tea</i> into America, and to impose a
tax thereon, in opposition to the wishes of the latter.
Accordingly, cargoes of tea were sent to New York, Philadelphia,
Charleston, and Boston. The fate of these cargoes,
thus sent, was different. Those destined for New
York and Philadelphia, were sent back by the inhabitants.
The citizens of Charleston unloaded the cargo sent thither,
and stored it in cellars, where it perished.</p>

<p>On the arrival of the vessel with the tea, in the harbor of
Boston, a meeting of the citizens was immediately called.
"The hour of destruction," it was said, "or of manly opposition,
had now come:" and all who were friends to their
country were invited to attend, "to make an united and successful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
resistance to this last and worst measure of administration."
A great number of people assembled, from the
adjoining towns, as well as from the capital, in the celebrated
Faneuil Hall, but the meeting was soon adjourned
to one of the largest churches in town. Here it was voted,
that they would use all lawful means to prevent its being
landed, and to have it returned immediately to England.</p>

<p>On the following day, when the citizens assembled to
receive the final answer of the factors, as to the course
they would pursue in disposing of the tea, a communication
was made to the meeting, in which the factors informed
them that they must decline sending back the tea; but
were ready to have it stored, and remain, until they could
hear from the company in England. The citizens continued
dissatisfied with the conduct and proposal of the
consignees, and again ordered a watch to guard the vessels.
It was also again voted, that whoever should import tea
into the province, should be considered an enemy to the
country.</p>

<p>When it was found that nothing could be effected in a regular
way, the meeting was broken up, and a number of men,
in disguise, proceeded, late in the evening, to the vessels,
then lying at the wharf, which had the tea on board; and, in
a short time, every chest was taken out, and the contents
thrown into the sea; but no injury was done to any other
part of the cargoes.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of the town, generally, had no knowledge
of the event until the next day. It is supposed the number
concerned in the affair was about fifty; but who they were
no one pretended to know. A few of them became known
in after years, when it was no longer liable to involve them
in trouble.</p>

<p>When intelligence of the destruction of the tea reached
Great Britain, and the determined spirit manifested in the
colonies, in opposition to all revenue laws, was made
known to the ministers, a majority at once resolved on more
energetic measures, and found themselves supported by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
parliament in their plans of coercion, regardless alike of
the great principles of the constitution, and of the permanent
peace and prosperity of the kingdom. Lord North,
it is said, declared "that he would not listen to any complaints

<p>In a few days, a bill was introduced "for the immediate
removal of the officers concerned in the collection of customs
from Boston, and to discontinue the landing and
discharging, lading and shipping goods, wares, and merchandise,
at Boston, or within the harbor thereof." The bill,
also, levied a fine upon the town, as a compensation to the
East India Company for the destruction of their teas, and
was to continue in force during the pleasure of the king.
The opposition to this measure was very slight, and it was
carried, in both Houses, without a division.</p>

<p>The 1st of June was fixed for the Boston port-bill to go
into operation, and the blockade was consequently to commence
on that day. On the 13th of May, at a meeting of
the inhabitants of Boston, it was resolved to invite the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
colonies to unite in refusing all importations from Great
Britain, and to withhold all commercial intercourse with
her. To secure their cöoperation, a special messenger was
dispatched to New York, Philadelphia, and other places;
in every place he was received with great cordiality, and
resolutions were immediately adopted, corresponding to the
wishes of the people of Boston.</p>

<p>Such was the state of affairs in the colonies generally, in
May, when General Gage arrived in Boston, as the successor
to Governor Hutchinson, who had been rëcalled.
At a former period, he had been, for several years, commander-in-chief
of the British military forces in America.
Notwithstanding the prejudices of the people to the appointment
of a military man, he was received with due honor,
and even great ceremony, by the council and citizens, all
of whom expressed a hope that his administration would
conduce to the peace and welfare of the province.</p>

<p>A short time, however, served to develope the character
of General Gage, and his servility to an arbitrary ministry
in the mother-country. He threatened to remove the
general assembly to Salem&mdash;gave his negative to thirteen
of the council chosen by the assembly&mdash;refused to appoint
a day for special prayer, at the request of that body&mdash;and,
finally, sent a proclamation, by his secretary, to dissolve
them.</p>

<p>At this period of increasing turmoil and agitation, the
second general congress assembled (September 5, 1774),
at Philadelphia, in which all the colonies were represented,
excepting Georgia. Peyton Randolph, of Virginia, was
elected president, and Charles Thompson, of Philadelphia,
secretary.</p>

<p>The most eminent men of the various colonies were now,
for the first time, brought together. They were known to
each other by fame, but they were, personally, strangers.
The meeting was solemn. The object which had called
them together, was of incalculable magnitude. The liberties
of no less than three millions of people, with that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
all their posterity, were staked on the wisdom and energy
of their councils. No wonder, then, at the long and deep
silence, which is said to have followed upon their organization;
at the anxiety with which the members looked
round upon each other; and at the reluctance which every
individual felt to open a business so fearfully momentous.
In the midst of this deep and death-like silence, and just
when it was becoming painfully embarrassing, Mr. Henry
arose slowly, as if borne down by the weight of the subject.
"After faltering, according to his habit, through a
most expressive exordium, in which he merely echoed
back the consciousness of every other heart, in deploring
his inability to do justice to the occasion, he launched gradually
into a recital of the colonial wrongs. Rising, as he
advanced, with the grandeur of his subject, and glowing,
at length, with all the majesty of the occasion, his speech
seemed more than that of mortal man. Mr. Henry was
followed by Mr. Richard Henry Lee, in a speech scarcely
less powerful, and still more replete with classic eloquence.
One spirit of ardent love of liberty pervaded every breast,
and produced a unanimity, as advantageous to the cause
they advocated, as it was unexpected and appalling to their
adversaries."<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>The congress proceeded with great deliberation; its
debates were held with closed doors, and the honor of each
member was solemnly engaged not to disclose any of the
discussions, till such disclosure was declared advisable by
the majority. On the 14th of October, a series of resolutions,
regarding the rights and grievances of the colonies, was
passed and promulgated. They were couched in strong
and undisguised language, and set forth to the world what
were considered, by this noble body of men, to be the
rights and privileges of the people of America, in defence
of which they were ready to peril life, liberty, and fortune.</p>

<p>"A majority of the members of this congress," says Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
Pitkin, "had little doubt, that the measures taken by them,
if supported by the American people, would produce a
redress of grievances.</p>

<p>"Richard Henry Lee said to Mr. Adams: 'We shall
undoubtedly carry all our points. You will be completely
relieved; all the offensive acts will be repealed, the army
and fleet will be rëcalled, and Britain will give up her
foolish projects.'</p>

   <p class="caption2">Patrick Henry.</p>
</div>

<p>"George Washington was of opinion that, with the aid
of both the non-importation and non-exportation system,
America would prevail. Patrick Henry concurred in
opinion with Mr. Adams, that the contest must ultimately
be decided by force. The proceedings of congress met
with the almost unanimous approbation of the people of
America. The non-importation agreement, entered into by
their delegates, was adopted as their own. Committees of
vigilance were appointed in all the towns and districts, and
the names of those who disregarded it, were published as
the enemies of public liberty."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span></p>

<p>Before the close of the year, the busy note of preparation
resounded through almost every colony. The Massachusetts
committee were indefatigable in providing for the
most vigorous defence in the spring. They had procured
all sorts of military supplies for the service of twelve
thousand men, and had engaged the assistance of the three
neighboring provinces of New Hampshire, Rhode Island,
and Connecticut.</p>

<p>While the notes of warlike preparation were thus sounding
louder and louder through the country, the British parliament
assembled on the other side of the waters. In
January, 1775, Lord Chatham having taken his seat, moved
"That an humble address be presented his majesty, most
humbly to advise and beseech his majesty, that, in order to
open the way towards our happy settlement of the dangerous
troubles in America, by beginning to allay ferments and
soften animosities there; and above all, for preventing, in
the mean time, any sudden and fatal catastrophe at Boston,
now suffering under daily irritation of an army before their
eyes, posted in their town; it may graciously please his
majesty, that immediate orders may be dispatched to General
Gage, for removing his majesty's forces from the town
of Boston, as soon as the season and other circumstances,
indispensable to the safety and accommodation of the said
troops, may render the same practicable."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this motion was persuasively urged by
Lord Chatham, and ably supported by Lord Camden, Lord
Shelburne, and the Marquis of Rockingham, it was rejected
by a large majority.</p>

<p>Immediately following its rejection, the minister proposed,
in the House of Commons, a joint address to the king, on
American affairs. In this address, which was carried by
large majorities, parliament declared that Massachusetts
was in a state of rebellion; and that this colony had been
supported by unlawful combinations, and engagements
entered into by several of the other colonies, to the great
injury and oppression of his majesty's subjects in Great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
Britain. Assuring his majesty of their determination never
to relinquish the sovereign authority of the king and parliament
over the colonies, they requested him to take the most
effectual measures to enforce obedience to that authority,
and promised him their support, at the hazard of their lives
and property. Opposition to the address was made in both
houses, but in vain. The king, in his answer, declared his
firm determination, in compliance with their request, to
enforce obedience to the laws and authority of the supreme
legislature of the empire. His answer was followed by a
message requesting an increase of his forces by sea and land.</p>

<p>Thus the determination of king and parliament was formed.
Left of God to follow the counsels of a proud, overbearing,
and obstinate ministry, they had now made declarations and
taken positions, from which there was no retreat but by
concessions, which were not to be expected. In due time,
"the news"&mdash;and, such intelligence had not before been
borne across the waters of the Atlantic&mdash;so exciting&mdash;so
appalling&mdash;so maddening&mdash;"the news arrived of the king's
speech at the opening of parliament; of the resolutions
adopted by that body; and, finally, of the act by which
the inhabitants of Massachusetts were proclaimed rebels.
All the province flew to arms; indignation became fury,&mdash;obstinacy,
desperation.</p>

<p>"'We must look back no more!' said the colonies&mdash;'we
must conquer or die! We are placed between altars
smoking with the most grateful incense of glory and
gratitude, on the one part, and blocks and dungeons on the
other. Let each then rise, and gird himself for the combat.
The dearest interests of this world command it; our most
holy religion enjoins it; that God, who eternally rewards
the virtuous and punishes the wicked, ordains it. Let us
accept these happy auguries; for already the mercenary
satellites, sent by wicked ministers to reduce this innocent
people to extremity, are imprisoned within the walls of a
single city, where hunger emaciates them, rage devours
them, death consumes them. Let us banish every fear,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
every alarm; fortune smiles upon the efforts of the brave!'
By similar discourses, they excited one another, and prepared
themselves for defence. 'The fatal moment is
arrived! the signal of civil war is given!'"<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>Thus was the way prepared for a contest which king
and parliament might, at one time, have easily avoided.
Had they listened to the warning voice of Chatham,
descending to his grave, or had they regarded the dictates
of common political wisdom, America might have been
retained, and with all her loyalty and affection, as a
dependency. But God designed a better portion for her;
and hence he allowed the monarch and the statesmen of
England to adopt measures the most impolitic and oppressive&mdash;the
result of which was&mdash;as we shall see&mdash;the independence
of America, and the loss to the British crown of
its brightest jewel.</p>

<p>The immediate cause of the battle, or, more properly,
rencontre at Lexington, was an attempt of a detachment
of British troops to execute an order of General Gage to
destroy certain military stores, which the provincials had
collected at Concord, a town situated some eighteen miles
from Boston. In anticipation of an approaching contest,
the provincial assembly of Massachusetts had passed a
resolution for the purchase of all the gunpowder that could
be found, and of every sort of arms and ammunition requisite
for an army of fifteen thousand men. As these objects
abounded principally in Boston, the inhabitants employed
all their address to procure and transport them to places of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
safety in the country. Cannon-balls and other instruments
of war were therefore collected and transported in carts,
apparently loaded with manure; powder in the baskets and
panniers of those who came from Boston market, and cartridges
were concealed even in candle-boxes. By these
means, and through other channels, a considerable quantity
of arms and ammunition had been collected at Concord.</p>

<p>Excited by the loyalists, General Gage resolved to send
a few companies to Concord, for the purpose already stated.
It was said, also, that he had it in view, by this sudden
expedition, to get possession of <i>John Hancock</i> and <i>Samuel
Adams</i>, two of the most ardent patriot chiefs, and the principal
directors of the provincial congress, then assembled
in the town of Concord.</p>

<p>In pursuance of the above purpose, on the evening of the
18th of April, several British officers dispersed themselves
here and there upon the road and passages, to intercept
the couriers that might have been dispatched to give notice
of the movements of the troops. The governor gave orders
that no person should be allowed to leave the city; nevertheless,
Dr. Warren, one of the most active patriots, had
timely intimation of the scheme, and immediately dispatched
confidential messengers; some of whom found the roads
interdicted by the officers who guarded them; but others
made their way unperceived to Lexington, a town upon
the road leading to Concord. The intelligence was soon
divulged; the people flocked together; the bells in all parts
were rung to give the alarm; and the continual firing of
cannon spread the agitation through all the neighboring
country. In the midst of this tumultuous scene, at eleven
in the evening, a strong detachment of grenadiers and of
light infantry was embarked at Boston, to land at a place
called Phipps' Farm, whence they marched to Concord.</p>

<p>The British troops were under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel
Smith and Major Pitcairn, who led the van-guard.
The militia of Lexington, as the intelligence of the
movement of this detachment was uncertain, had separated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
in the course of the night. Finally, at five in the morning
of the 19th, advice was received of the near approach of
the royal troops. The provincials that happened to be
near, assembled&mdash;to the number, however, of only seventy.
The English appeared; and Major Pitcairn, galloping up
to them, in a loud voice cried, "Disperse, rebels! lay down
your arms, and disperse!"</p>

<p>The provincials did not obey; upon which, advancing
nearer, he discharged a pistol, and, brandishing his sword,
ordered his soldiers to fire. Eight Americans were killed,
three or four of them by the first fire of the British; the
others, after they had left the parade. Several were also
wounded. A handsome monument has been erected to
the memory of the killed, on the green where the first of
them fell.</p>

   <p class="caption2">Battle of Lexington.</p>
</div>

<p>Meanwhile, Hancock and Adams retired from danger;
and it is related that, while on the march, the latter, enraptured
with joy, exclaimed, "Oh, what an ever-glorious
morning is this!"&mdash;considering this first effusion of blood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
as the prelude of events which must secure the happiness
of his country. The soldiers advanced towards Concord,
where the inhabitants assembled; but seeing the numbers
of the enemy, they fell back, and posted themselves on a
bridge, north of the town. The light infantry assailed them
with fury, routed them, and occupied the bridge, while the
others entered Concord, and proceeded to the execution of
their orders. They disabled two twenty-four pounders,
threw five hundred pounds of ball into the river and wells,
and broke in pieces about sixty barrels of flour.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="illus-272.jpg" id="illus-272.jpg"></a>
   <img src="images/illus-272.jpg" alt="Captain Wheeler and the British Officer." title="Captain Wheeler and the British Officer."/>
   <p class="caption2">Captain Wheeler and the British Officer.</p>
</div>

<p>During the search of the British for military stores, a
British officer demanded entrance into the barn of Captain
Wheeler. This was readily granted. In it was stored a
large quantity of provincial flour. The officer expressed
his pleasure at the discovery. But Captain Wheeler, with
much affected simplicity, said to him, putting his hand on a
barrel, "This is my flour. I am a miller, sir; yonder stands
my mill; I get my living by it. In the winter, I grind a
great deal of grain, and get it ready for market in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
spring. This," (pointing to one barrel,) "is the flour of
wheat; this," (pointing to another,) "is the flour of corn;
this is the flour of rye; this," (putting his hand on his own
cask,) "is <i>my</i> flour; this is <i>my</i> wheat; this is <i>my</i> rye; this is
<i>mine.</i>" "Well," said the officer, "we do not injure <i>private</i> property," and withdrew, leaving this important depository
untouched.</p>

<p>The militia being rëinforced, Major Buttrick, of Concord,
who had gallantly offered to command them, advanced
towards the bridge; but, not knowing of the transaction at
Lexington, ordered the men not to give the first fire, that
the provincials might not be the aggressors. As he
advanced, the light infantry retired to the Concord side of
the river, and began to pull up the bridge; and on his nearer
approach, they fired, and killed a captain and one of the
privates. The provincials returned the fire; a skirmish
ensued, and the regulars were forced to retreat, with some
loss. They were soon joined by the main body, which
now retreated with precipitancy. Meanwhile, the people
of the adjacent country flocked in, and attacked them in
every direction. Some fired from behind stone walls and
other coverts; while others pressed on their rear during
their retreat to Lexington.</p>

<p>General Gage, apprehensive for the fate of the English,
had dispatched nine hundred men and two field-pieces,
under command of Lord Percy. This corps arrived very
opportunely at Lexington, at the moment when the royal
troops entered the town from the other side, pursued with
fury by the provincial militia.</p>

<p>It appears highly probable that, without this rëinforcement,
they would have all been cut to pieces or made
prisoners; their strength was exhausted, as well as their
ammunition. After making a considerable halt at Lexington,
they renewed their march towards Boston, the
number of the provincials increasing, although the rear-guard
of the English was less molested, on account of
the two field-pieces, which repressed the impetuosity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
the Americans. But the flanks of the columns remained
exposed to a destructive fire, from every point adapted to
serve as coverts. The royalists were also annoyed by the
heat, which was excessive, and by a violent wind, which
blew a thick dust in their eyes. Finally, after a march of
incredible fatigue, and considerable loss of men, the English,
overwhelmed with lassitude, arrived at sunset in Charlestown.
Independently of the combat they had sustained,
the distance they had that day traveled was above five-and-thirty
miles. The day following, they crossed over
to Boston.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>The rencontre at Lexington was, in itself, an inconsiderable
affair. But, in its relation and influence, its importance
can scarcely be estimated. It was the first outbreak
of indignant feeling, which, for months and years, had been
acquiring strength, but which, until now, had been suppressed.
It was a solution of the problem, whether the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
wrongs of America could be redressed without a resort to
arms. It developed the spirit and determination, as well
of the king and parliament, as of the Americans themselves.
It shut the door for further negotiation; it cut off
hope for the colonies, but through an appeal to arms. In
fact, it was a signal for war&mdash;<i>it was war itself</i>.</p>

<p>The affair had two results. The <i>first</i> was to demonstrate
how false and ridiculous were the vaunts of those
Gascons who, within parliament as well as without, had
spoken in such unworthy terms of American courage;
from this moment, the English nation, and especially its
soldiers, persuaded themselves that the struggle would be
far more severe and sanguinary than had been at first
believed. The <i>second</i> effect of the combat was, greatly to
increase the confidence of the colonists, and their resolution
to defend their rights. It should be added, also, that
the reports of the cruelties of the British troops produced
an incredible excitement in the minds of the inhabitants,
which was still further increased by the public honors
which were paid to those who had fallen in the opening
contest. Their eulogies were pronounced, and they were
styled martyrs of liberty, while their families were the
objects of unusual veneration. They were cited as the
models to be imitated in the approaching conflict.</p>

<p>The provincial congress of Massachusetts was in session
at Watertown, ten miles distant from Boston. On receiving
intelligence of the battle, it took immediate measures
to raise thirteen thousand and six hundred men, and chose
for their general Colonel Ward, an officer of much reputation.
This militia was designed to form the contingent of
Massachusetts; the provinces of New Hampshire, Connecticut,
and Rhode Island were invited to furnish theirs,
in order to complete an army of thirty thousand men, to be
commanded by General John Thomas, an officer of great
experience. Connecticut dispatched, immediately, a considerable
corps, under the command of Colonel Putnam, an
old officer, who, in the two late wars, had often given proof<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
of courage and intelligence. The other provinces were
not slow in causing their standards to move; and, in a short
time, an army of thirty thousand men was found assembled
under the walls of Boston. So great and so universal was
the ardor produced among the inhabitants by the battle of
Lexington, that the American generals were obliged to
send back to their homes many thousand volunteers. Putnam
took his station at Cambridge, and Thomas at Roxbury,
upon the right wing of the army, to cut off entirely
the communication of the garrison, by the isthmus, with the
adjacent country. Thus, in a few days after the affair of
Lexington, the capital of the province of Massachusetts was
closely besieged; thus a multitude assembled in haste, of
men, declared rebels and mean-spirited cowards, held in
strict confinement, not daring to sally forth even to procure
food, many thousands of veteran troops, commanded by an
able general, and combating under the royal standard.</p>

<p>Boston, which for a considerable time had been the
point of greatest interest in the American colonies, was
not less so immediately following the battle of Lexington.
That engagement served to quicken the already
excited pulse of thousands. The fires of patriotism burned
brighter. Sires and sons, mothers and daughters, rejoiced
that the crisis had come, and were ready to make every
needful sacrifice for their country's good. In a few weeks,
the metropolis of the province of Massachusetts was environed
by an American army, fifteen thousand strong&mdash;ten
thousand of which was furnished by Massachusetts, and
three thousand by Connecticut; the rest were supplied by
the other New England colonies. Of these troops, General
Ward was commander-in-chief. His head-quarters were
at Cambridge. The right-wing was stationed at Roxbury,
the left at Medford and Chelsea.</p>

<p>Towards the end of May, a considerable rëinforcement
arrived at Boston from England, which, with the garrison,
formed an army of from ten to twelve thousand men&mdash;all
veteran troops. At the head of this rëinforcement were
three distinguished and practical generals&mdash;Howe, Clinton,
and Burgoyne.</p>

<p>The difference in numbers was on the side of the Americans&mdash;not
so, however, their military science, arms, or
ammunition. They had, in all, but sixteen field-pieces, six
of which, at the very utmost, were in a condition for service.
Their brass pieces, which were few, were of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
smallest caliber. They had, however, some heavy iron
cannon, with three or four mortars and howitzers, and some
scanty provision of balls and bombs. But of powder, they
were almost totally destitute.</p>

<p>The situation of the English was now daily becoming
more perplexing and critical, and the necessity was increasingly
apparent, if they intended to retain their position, of
fortifying certain points in the neighborhood. The two
regarded of greatest importance were the heights of Dorchester
and Charlestown. The former presenting superior
inducements, it was determined to occupy and fortify that
first, and, afterwards, the latter.</p>

<p>The Americans having learned the intentions of the
British general, it became a serious question what course
was most prudent for them to adopt. For a time, a difference
of opinion prevailed among the American patriots;
but, at length, the committee of safety recommended to the
council of war to occupy and fortify Bunker's hill at once,
and Dorchester heights (now South Boston), as early after
as practicable.</p>

<p>In conformity with this suggestion, on the following day
(16th June), General Ward issued orders to Colonel Prescott
to proceed to Charlestown, and occupy and fortify
Bunker's hill.</p>

<p>The troops detached for this service, amounted to about
one thousand men. They were ordered to take provisions
but for a single day. In the early part of the evening of
the 16th, they were mustered on Cambridge common, near
the colleges. They were commended to the protection
and guidance of Almighty God, in a prayer by President
Langdon; after which, led by the valiant Prescott, attired
in a <i>calico frock</i>, and himself preceded by two sergeants
with dark lanterns, and accompanied by Colonel Gridley
and Judge Winthrop of Cambridge, they took their
destined path.</p>

<p>Having reached the ground, a question arose which of
the two hills was intended as Bunker's hill. The northern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
eminence was more generally spoken of under that name,
while the southern, commonly called Breed's hill, was
evidently the one best fitted for the purpose. After long
deliberation, it was decided to construct the principal work
on Breed's hill, and to erect an additional and subsidiary
one on Bunker's hill. Accordingly, Captain Gridley proceeded
to lay out the principal work. Midnight arrived,
however, before a spade entered the ground; there remained
therefore less than four hours before day-light, when the
operations would, of course, be seen by the British. The
men, however, now began, and they <i>worked</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>Meanwhile, a strong guard, under Captain Manners, was
stationed on the Charlestown shore, to watch the enemy.
The day had been fair, and it was a clear, star-light night.
Colonel Prescott, accompanied by Major Brooks, went down
twice to the shore to reconnoitre, and distinctly heard the
British sentries relieving guard, and uttering, as they walked
their rounds, the customary, but, in this instance deceptive,
cry, "All's well!"<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span></p>
<p>The night, on the part of the patriot band, was one of
sleepless vigilance and incessant toil. Shovels, pickaxes, and
spades, were in incessant motion; and, by four o'clock in the
morning, they had thrown up a redoubt, eight rods square
and four feet high. At this time, the captain of a British
ship, called the <i>Lively</i>, discovered the work, and opened a
fire upon it. The alarm was given to the British in Boston,
and to the men-of-war in the river, and a heavy cannonade
was commenced. The fire from a battery of six guns, on
Copp's hill, proved most annoying; but the Americans,
regardless of bombs and balls, continued their labors with
unshaken constancy. The first martyr who had the honor
of shedding his blood, on that ever-memorable hill, was a
private soldier by the name of <i>Asa Pollard</i>, of Billerica,
and the shot which killed him was the only one which took
fatal effect during the forenoon.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

   <img src="images/illus-280.jpg" alt="Death of Pollard." title="Death of Pollard."/>
   <p class="caption2">Death of Pollard.</p>
</div>

<p>While various movements were in progress, the Americans
in the neighborhood of the redoubt were by no means
idle. About two hundred yards in the rear of the breastwork<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
was a stone fence surmounted with rails. In front of
this, another fence was constructed, and the space between
the two filled with hay, which happened to be on the field.
A subsidiary work was also hastily thrown up on Bunker's
hill, properly so called, by General Putnam.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

   <img src="images/illus-281.jpg" alt="General Putnam." title="General Putnam."/>
   <p class="caption2">General Putnam.</p>
</div>

<p>From the moment the British discovered the operations
of the Americans, they well knew the importance of dislodging
them from their position. They had expected to
attain this object by a cannonade from their batteries and
ships of war; but it was soon apparent that other and more
effective measures would be necessary. Accordingly, after
mature consultation in a council of war, summoned by General
Gage, it was resolved to transport a competent force
across the river, and attack the works in front.</p>

<p>It was "a day without clouds," and intensely hot. Between
mid-day and one o'clock, twenty-eight barges were
seen moving from the end of Long wharf towards Morton's
point. On board of these were four battalions of
infantry and ten of grenadiers. They had six pieces of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
artillery, one of which was placed in each of the six leading
boats.</p>

<p>About two o'clock, a second detachment left Winnisimmett
ferry, and joined the first at Morton's point. These
were soon after followed by rëinforcements, which landed
at Madlin's ship-yard, now the navy-yard near the east end
of Breed's hill. These several detachments, amounting to
about four thousand men, were under command of General
Howe, subordinate to whom were General Pigot, and
Colonels Nesbit, Abercrombie, and Clark.</p>

   <p class="caption2">Interview between Putnam and Warren.</p>
</div>

<p>A short time before the action commenced, a horseman
was perceived advancing rapidly from Charlestown, towards
the American redoubt. It proved to be General Warren,
the president of the provincial congress. "Ah!" said Putnam,
as the former came up, "is it you, General? I am glad
to see you, and yet I regret your presence. Your life is
too precious to be thus exposed; but since you are here,
let me receive your orders." "No," replied the gallant
soldier; "I give no orders! I come as a volunteer; and now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
say where I can be the most useful." "Go, then," said
Putnam, "to the redoubt; you will there be less exposed."
"Tell me," rejoined Warren, "where will be the point of
greatest danger." "The redoubt will be the enemy's first
and principal object," said Putnam; "if we can defend that,
the day is ours." Warren passed on, and, as he passed,
the troops recognised him, and loud and long were their
acclamations. Every bosom felt the impulse of his presence.
At the redoubt, Prescott received him, and begged
him to receive the command. "Give me a musket," said
Warren; "to-day I take a lesson from the veteran soldier
in the art of war." Warren could not content himself
away from the dangers which were thickening around the
patriotic cause. The day previous, he had presided in the
congress in session at Watertown, and had spent the entire
night in transacting business growing out of his official
station. On reaching Cambridge, early in the morning, he
received intelligence of the expected battle. He attended
a meeting of the committee of safety, of which he was
chairman. Here he made known his intention of taking
part in the approaching contest. "Your ardent temper,"
said Gerry, "will carry you forward in the midst of peril,
and you will probably fall." "I know that I may fall,"
replied Warren, "but I should die with shame, were I to
remain at home in safety, while my friends and fellow-citizens
are shedding their blood, and hazarding their lives
in the cause." The honor of Warren is greatly enhanced
by the consideration that he was originally opposed to the
plan of fortifying the heights of Charlestown, but no sooner
had the council of war decided upon that measure, than he
gave it his hearty cöoperation. And here we see this brave
and patriotic man in the field of battle, and in the midst
of danger, having adopted the beautiful sentiment of the
Roman poet,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The action opened at about three o'clock in the afternoon,
at which time a general discharge of artillery was ordered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
along the whole British line. At the same time, the troops
advanced in two divisions. General Howe led the right
towards the rail-fence; General Pigot with the left end
towards the redoubt.</p>

<p>The march of the British troops was slow, but steady.
They wore the aspect of strong confidence and strong
determination. Meanwhile, the American drums beat to
arms. Quitting his intrenchment, where he was still at
work on Bunker's hill, Putnam led his equally determined,
but far less disciplined, troops into action. Said this veteran
general, in his usual pointed and laconic style, "Fellow-soldiers!
powder is scarce, and must not be wasted.
Reserve your fire till you see the whites of their eyes.
Then take aim at the officers."</p>

<p>This injunction, however, having been disobeyed by a
few of the more restless and impetuous, Prescott, proceeding
along the lines, said, in a tone of thunder: "The next
man that fires before the order is given, shall be instantly
shot." It was apparently cruel thus to require troops,
whose bosoms were now glowing with burning zeal, to
withhold their fire, while the enemy was pouring in his at
every step of his progress. It was, however, a wise delay.
At length, the British had advanced within eight rods of the
redoubt. "Now, men," said Prescott, "now is your time!
Make ready! Take aim! Fire!"</p>

<p>And such a deadly fire, perhaps, was never before made;
and, when the smoke rolled off, such a sight was perhaps
never before seen. The hill-side was covered with the
slain. The ranks of the British were broken, and confusion
appeared on every side. The British officers attempted to
rally their troops. In this, they succeeded so far as to induce
them to fire; but, evidently appalled at the fearful and unexpected
carnage, they turned, and fled down the hill.</p>

<p>"Following this repulse, there was an ominous pause,"
says a writer, "like the lull that sometimes interrupts the
wildest tempest, only broken by the occasional discharge
of artillery from the ships and batteries." It was not,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
however, of long duration. A second attack was decided
upon, and orders issued again to advance. Meanwhile, a
deep silence brooded over the American lines, all being
intent upon the devastation which had been made, and
watching for the future movements of the enemy which
had been so signally repulsed. Their success had greatly
exceeded their own expectations, and served to inspire
them with still more confidence in a second rencontre which
they might now momently expect. In the first attack, they
had been directed to reserve their fire until the enemy had
approached within eight rods; now they must wait until
the enemy should approach within six rods.</p>

<p>While the British troops were advancing, suddenly a
new spectacle burst upon the eyes of the tens of thousands
who were looking on from every neighboring eminence,
which greatly added to the sublimity of the scene.</p>

<p>Annoyed in his first attack upon the American redoubt,
by the fire of a detachment stationed at Charlestown, General
Howe had given directions to fire that town, both by
way of revenging the injury he had sustained, and, also,
the more to distract the Americans during his second
attack, to which he was now advancing. In furtherance
of this object, a large quantity of combustibles had been
conveyed from Boston, and a detachment of marines, from
the Somerset, been landed to set them on fire. The work
of conflagration was now commenced. Dense and dark
clouds of smoke rose over the town, and at length enveloped
the whole peninsula; through this smoke, columns of
flame shot up, and flashed in every direction. The fire
spread with fearful rapidity from house to house, and from
street to street. At length, the flames reached the church,
and, climbing its lofty steeple, converted it into a blazing
pyramid. The beams, supporting the bell, were burned in
sunder, upon which it fell, and while falling, its pealing
sounds were distinctly heard by hundreds, uniting with
crackling flames and crashing edifices in enhancing the
dreadful magnificence of the day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p>

<p>It was in the midst of a scene of desolation like this&mdash;by
which property to the amount of one hundred and twenty
thousand pounds sterling was destroyed, six hundred buildings
consumed, and two thousand people rendered houseless&mdash;the
two opposing forces were preparing for another
sanguinary rencontre. The British general was leading on
his troops, as cool and undisturbed as if they had met with
no repulse. They opened their fire by platoons, and apparently
at random, yet not entirely without effect. Colonels
Nixon and Brewer were borne wounded from the works.
A ball through his shoulder rendered Colonel Backminster
a cripple for life. Major Moore received a shot through
the thigh; soon after which, a second ball pierced his body,
which subsequently proved mortal.</p>

<p>The Americans had been charged to reserve their fire
till the enemy were within six rods. The success which
had attended their former delay, now enabled them the more
cheerfully to yield obedience to orders, a compliance with
which had, in the first instance, seemed nearly impossible.
At length, the enemy reached the prescribed distance,
when the anticipated words, "Make ready! Take aim!
Fire!" were heard in a voice like thunder&mdash;and, in an
instant, hundreds of men, including a surprising number of
principal officers, were seen prostrated in the dust. The
fire proved even more destructive than in the first attack.
General Howe was left nearly alone, almost every officer
of his staff being either killed or wounded. So sweeping
had been the destruction, that the ranks were fatally
broken, and a second time orders were issued for the
British army to make good their retreat.</p>

<p>An interesting incident is related, as having occurred
immediately following the fire of the Americans. Among
the British officers who escaped the terrible destruction,
was Major Small; but, so fatal had been the fire, that
scarcely was there a man left near him. Consequently, his
superior dress rendered him a more conspicuous object.
Several riflemen had marked him&mdash;had indeed raised their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
guns, and were in the act of levelling them, when Putnam
recognised Major Small, and perceived the imminent danger
he was in. A moment longer, and his early friend,
with whom he had served in the French war, and for
whom he cherished an unfeigned regard, would be in the
agonies of death. He sprang upon the parapet, and rushed
immediately before the levelled rifles, exclaiming: "My
gallant comrades! spare, spare that officer! we are friends;
we are brothers. Do you not remember how we rushed
into each others' arms, at the meeting for the exchange of
prisoners?" The appeal, it needs scarcely be added, was
successful. Every rifle was instantly lowered; every
bosom glowed with the generous emotions which filled
that of the high-souled Putnam; nor was one feeling of
regret indulged, as the gallant British officer retired
unharmed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

   <p class="caption2">Putnam saves the life of Major Small.</p>
</div>

<p>Although repulsed in a second attack, and with losses as
signal as unexpected, Howe immediately decided upon
renewing the contest. Upon the issue of that day, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
results of this single conflict, he well knew, might hang the
fortunes of the British cause in America. If successful,
the patriots would become disheartened; if defeated, they
would take courage, and continue the controversy with
greater animation. With more wisdom, he decided to
concentrate his whole force upon the redoubt&mdash;and, that
his troops might act with greater energy, he directed them
to lay aside their cumbersome knapsacks, and, in imitation
of the Americans, to reserve their fire, or, if circumstances
allowed, to rely upon the bayonet.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the situation of the Americans had become
critical and alarming. They had, indeed, lost comparatively
few of their number; but it was discovered, we
might almost say to their dismay, that their ammunition
was nearly exhausted. They had little prospect of any
further supply; they had few, if any bayonets, and, as to
rëinforcements, though extremely desirable, and now necessary,
they could indulge only slight hopes. They were,
however, cheered by the prospect of a rëinforcement of
three hundred men at this critical juncture. The regiment
of Colonel Gardiner, stationed at Charlestown, although
they had received no orders to that effect, that gallant
officer volunteered to bring to their assistance. Most
unfortunately, however, just as he was descending to the
lines, a musket-ball struck him, which soon after proved
mortal. In consequence of this untoward event, his regiment
became disordered, and but a single company that
marched from Charlestown, under command of Captain
Harris, participated in the action. It was, however, and
well does it attest their patriotic courage, the very last to
leave the field.</p>

<p>The history of the American war furnishes many an
incident of thrilling interest, and many an instance of
heroic bravery and devotion to the cause of liberty: the
last moments of Colonel Gardiner may be ranked among
the number. On receiving his wound, he was borne from
the field by some of his men; when his son, a youth of only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
nineteen, and a second lieutenant in Trevett's artillery
company, rushed forward to his father's aid. On beholding
him, said the father: "Think not of me, my son. I am
well. Go to your duty!" And the son obeyed, and
hastened to his post, while the father was borne from the
field to die. Is it a matter of marvel that people should
succeed in a struggle where such lofty patriotism fired
their bosoms, and, in pursuing which, some of the tenderest
and strongest ties of our nature were sacrificed for their
country's good?</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

   <img src="images/illus-289.jpg" alt="Death of Colonel Gardiner." title="Death of Colonel Gardiner."/>
   <p class="caption2">Death of Colonel Gardiner.</p>
</div>

<p>The British troops, as we said, were again advancing.
Without bayonets, with a few charges of powder remaining,
the Americans waited in silence to receive them as
they were able. Stones and the stocks of their muskets
supplied the place of powder and ball. Richardson, a private
in the Royal Irish regiment, was the first to mount the
parapet; but he fell the next moment. Nearly at the same
time, Major Pitcairn, whose insolence and inhumanity at
Lexington will not soon be forgotten, appeared upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
parapet, and, as if actuated by a similar spirit now as then,
he exultingly exclaimed: "The day is ours!" But here he
met a deserved fate; for, while the words still lingered on
his lies, a bullet from a musket, fired by a colored man
named Salem, pierced his body, and he fell and expired.</p>

<p>While these events were occurring in one quarter, the
enemy were more successful in another, the south-east
corner of the redoubt. Here a tree had been left standing,
and by means of this, General Pigot succeeded in mounting
the works; his men followed him; and here, for a brief
space, the contest was spirited and sanguinary. Several
American officers suffered severely. Colonel Bridge was
twice wounded by a broad-sword. Major Gridley received
a ball through the leg, and was borne from the field.
Lieutenant Prescott, nephew to the colonel, had his arm
so broken, as to hang useless by his side; but, nothing
deterred by his wound, he continued to load his musket, and
was in the act of pointing his gun through the sally-port at
the enemy, when he was cut in sunder by a cannon-ball.
But now, the sacrifice of life which was being offered upon
the shrine of liberty, was accomplishing no good. The
Americans could no longer contend with hope, as their
ammunition was fairly expended. Prescott was reluctant
to yield; but it was wise&mdash;it was best. An honorable
retreat was still practicable, and he chose this alternative.
The Americans retired in order from the hill.</p>

<p>A retreat bore more heavily upon one patriotic spirit
than, if possible, upon all others&mdash;that one was Warren's.
He lingered to the very latest moment&mdash;beyond the moment
of safety. Nor had he quitted the works, or proceeded but
a few rods, when the British were in full possession. Major
Small, the British officer whose life Putnam had saved only
a few hours before, saw him&mdash;surmised his reluctance&mdash;perceived
his danger&mdash;and would have saved him. Addressing
him by name, he besought him to surrender, as
the only means of security; at the same time ordering his
men to suspend their firing. Warren, it is supposed, heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
the voice of Small; but whether he would have taken
advantage of the proffered safety, cannot be known. He
turned his head towards the sound, and at that instant a
ball sunk deep in his forehead, and produced instant death.</p>

<p>The day following, the body of this patriot, statesman,
and hero, was discovered and identified by Isaac Winslow,
(then a youth, afterwards general,) and by several others,
who were familiar with his person. The bullet which terminated
his life was extracted by Mr. Savage, an officer in
the custom-house. Subsequently, he carried it to England;
but, years afterwards, it was presented at London to Rev.
Mr. Montague, of Dedham, Mass., in whose family it still
remains. The remains of Warren were buried on the spot
where he fell; but the following year they were temporarily
removed to a tomb in the Tremont cemetery. They now
repose in the family vault, under St. Paul's church, Boston.</p>

<p>The loss of Warren was among the saddest and bitterest
incidents of the day. Few had such aspirations after liberty&mdash;few
so well understood the true interests of the country,
or were better able to suggest measures calculated to secure
the triumph of her cause. To the British, the intelligence
of his fall was as grateful (considering him in the light of
an enemy) as it was unexpected. It is recorded that when
on the following morning the news of the event was brought
to General Howe, who remained on the field during the
night, he would scarcely credit it; and when, at length, it
was verified, he declared that "his death was a full offset
for the loss of five hundred men."</p>

<p>The battle of Bunker's hill, which we have thus described
as minutely as our limits will allow, was of about two hours'
continuance, having commenced at three o'clock. The
Americans engaged were estimated at about three thousand
five hundred. The number killed and missing was one
hundred and fifteen; three hundred and five were wounded,
and thirty taken prisoners. Of the several regiments,
Prescott's suffered the most severely, losing forty-two killed
and twenty-eight wounded. Several officers were killed&mdash;Colonel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
Gardiner, Lieutenant-Colonel Parker, Major Moore,
and Major Maclary.</p>

<p>The British force engaged in this battle was four thousand.
Their loss General Gage, in his official account, acknowledged
to be one thousand and fifty-four&mdash;two hundred and
twenty-six killed; eight hundred and twenty-eight wounded,
including nineteen officers killed and twenty-eight wounded.
Their loss, according to the official account of the action
by the Massachusetts congress, was fifteen hundred.</p>

<p>Charlestown was entirely destroyed. On the retreat of
the Americans, the British took possession of Bunker's hill,
from which they kept up a fire of artillery during the night.
The Americans occupied Prospect and Winter hills.</p>

<p>It was a bold attempt on the part of General Howe to
carry the American redoubt by an attack in <i>front</i>; in consequence
of this, his troops were exposed to the direct and
galling fire of men who were each able to take deliberate
aim. A censure was indeed cast upon him for so doing;
but a too vain confidence in the bravery and discipline of
his soldiers, and an equally mistaken estimate of American
valor, led him to reject a plan proposed by General Clinton,
and the adoption of one which, had it succeeded, would
have secured more honor, but which obviously was so
hazardous and doubtful in its issue, as might well have
gained for the other the preference.</p>

<p>The night of the 17th of June was one of more sadness
to the British than to the Americans, notwithstanding that
the latter had been driven from their position, and the colors
of the former were waving over Bunker's hill. To the
British belonged the field&mdash;to the Americans, <i>in effect</i>, the
victory. What the former had gained, was of no use to
them, as their forces were not sufficiently numerous to hold
possession of so extended a line. Their loss in numbers
was grievous; but this was small in comparison to the mortification
experienced in view of their repeated repulses.
Nor was that mortification lessened when it became known
that the retreat of the Americans was caused by a want of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
ammunition. Had the <i>materiel</i> of battle not failed, who
can say that the Americans would not have maintained
their position?<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>Such an issue, however, might have drawn after it consequences
which, in the sequel, would have been disastrous
to the patriotic cause. A vain confidence might have been
engendered, leading to the neglect of needful, and even
essential preparation, to cope with a foe more formidable at
that era, than any other on the globe. It was well doubtless,
and Providence in kindness so ordered, it, that ammunition
should fail. God gave to the Americans just that success
which was calculated to animate and encourage them: and
permitted them to suffer just in that way, and to that extent,
as to teach them humility, and to trust in Him. Theirs was
a just and glorious cause. It was the cause of liberty and
of God. It was right that they should succeed; but it was
equally befitting that they should feel and acknowledge
that their success was from the God of their fathers.</p>

<p>If, previous to the battle of Bunker's hill, doubts existed
in the minds of any, whether the contest between Great
Britain and America would be settled without a struggle,
the sanguinary scene on that hill must have dispelled them.
Both parties had received a wound not likely soon to be
healed. If the British had won the field, they had gained
but little, if any, honor&mdash;and in the repulse, which the
Americans had met with, while they had lost no honor,
they had acquired self-confidence, and added to their
already high-wrought valor and determination.</p>

<p>"The battle was fought on Saturday afternoon. Before
Sunday night, the intelligence was spread more than a
hundred miles distant from the scene of action. All were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
roused to the highest pitch of resentment, and set about
preparing themselves for a long and bloody struggle.
Companies were raised and equipped with the utmost
dispatch; all hopes of reconciliation were lost. Squads
of armed men flocked to head-quarters, some of them
having traveled eighty miles in twenty-four hours."</p>

<p>While events of so much importance were occurring in
and around Boston, the more immediate theatre of the war,
the second general congress were in session in Philadelphia,
in deep consultation as to measures which the cause and
exigencies of the country required.</p>

<p>Their session had commenced on the 10th day of May
preceding. Various matters of interest engaged their
attention, and required all their wisdom and firmness. As
the war had commenced, it was essential to keep up the
zeal of the people&mdash;to prevent revolt to the royal standard&mdash;to
introduce discipline into an army which had been collected
in haste&mdash;to provide for the growing expenses of a
war, the end of which could not be predicted&mdash;to prevent,
in the conduct of the war, the revival of jealousies which
had existed between the different colonies&mdash;and, finally, to
place the army in the hands of some commander-in-chief,
in whom the country could confide, and whose commands
the army would cheerfully obey.</p>

<p>The importance of this last duty magnified, the more it
was contemplated&mdash;and difficulties presented themselves
which occasioned no small anxiety and embarrassment.
A mistake here might prove fatal to the liberties of the
country, for an indefinite period to come.</p>

<p>Upon whom, then, should their choice fall? Gates and
Lee were held in high estimation as military men. The
first, for his experience; the second, because to experience
he joined a very active genius. But they were both born
in England, and, in case of misfortune, it would be difficult,
however upright and faithful they might have been, to persuade
the people that they had not been guilty of treason,
or at least of negligence in the accomplishment of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
duties. Besides, Lee had an impetuosity of temper, which,
in some hour of excitement, might spur him to the adoption
of measures inconsistent with the safety of the army, and
prejudicial to the interests of the patriot cause. There
were also Ward and Putnam, who were already in the
field, and who had demonstrated the most signal valor and
ability in all the actions which had taken place in the
vicinity of Boston. Putnam had seen much service, and,
for energy and promptitude, had few equals; but he had
declared himself too openly in favor of independence;
this, congress devoutly wished to procure, but withal in a
propitious time. As to General Ward, New England, it
was well known, entertained an exalted opinion of him, and
many were strongly wishing and anticipating that the lot
would fall on him. He had served in the French war, in
which he had acquired an honorable distinction. In addition,
he was both a scholar and a gentleman, and the army
itself was uncommonly prepossessed in his favor. But
besides that he also had openly expressed himself in favor
of independence, it was well known that the provinces of
the middle, and more so of the south, were in a measure
jealous of New England, in which the physical force of
the country confessedly predominated, and they would
naturally be reluctant to have the cause of America confided
to the hands of an individual who might allow himself
to be influenced by certain local prepossessions, at a time
in which all desires and all interests ought to be common.
Nor was it a small desideratum with some of the sages of
that era, that the commander-in-chief should himself possess
an estate of such value as to offer a guaranty of his fidelity,
and elevate him above the sordid and selfish motives of
personal gain.</p>

<p>Surrounded by such difficulties, and embarrassed by such
opposite considerations, what was to be done? One point
was clear,&mdash;<i>union must be preserved</i>, at any sacrifice.
Union was strength. If in harmonious concert the colonies
could not proceed, their doom was sealed. The country,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
and the whole country, must come in. The pulsation must
beat through all hearts. The cause was one, and how
many soever bore a part in sustaining and defending it,
they must act as impelled but by one motive&mdash;and using
but a single arm.</p>

<p>To the final question, it had been foreseen for some time,
the congress must come. Out of doors, the subject had
been considered and debated, but, as yet, no settled opinion
had been formed, and no decisive action had been had.</p>

<p>In this anxious and inquiring period, the Father of mercies&mdash;that
Almighty Being by whose care the colonies had
been planted, and hitherto sustained&mdash;whose blessing was
daily sought by thousands of families, morning and evening&mdash;whose
guidance the public councils, whether provincial
or continental, were never ashamed to implore&mdash;that good
and gracious Benefactor was not slow in pointing to the
man who should lead the armies of his American Israel!</p>

<p>One morning, the elder President Adams was walking in
Congress hall, apparently absorbed in thought, when Samuel
Adams, a kinsman and a member of congress, approaching
him, inquired the subject of his deep cogitation. "The
army," he replied; "I am determined what to do about the
army at Cambridge." "What is that?" asked his kinsman.
"I am determined to enter on a full detail of the state of
the colonies, before the house this morning. My object
will be to induce congress to name a day for adopting the
army, as the legal army of the United Colonies of North
America; and, having done this, I shall offer a few hints on
my election of a commander-in-chief." "I like your plan,
Cousin John," said Samuel Adams; "but on whom have
you fixed as this commander?" "George Washington, of
Virginia, a member of this house." "That will never do,
never, never." "It <i>must</i> do," said John Adams, "and for
these reasons: the southern and middle states are loath to
enter heartily into the cause, and their arguments are potent;
they see that New England holds the physical power in her
hands, and they fear the result. A New England army, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
New England commander, with New England perseverance,
all united, appal them. For this cause, they hang back.
The only way to allay their fears, and silence their complaints,
is by appointing a southern chief over the army.
This policy will blend us in one mass, and that mass will
be resistless."</p>

<p>Mr. Adams now went in, and, taking the floor, put forth
his strength in the delineations he had prepared, all aiming
at the adoption of the army. <i>He</i> was ready to own the
army, appoint a commander, and vote supplies. His speech
was patriotic, eloquent, and thrilling; but some doubted,
some objected, some feared. To all these doubts and hesitations,
he replied: "Gentlemen, if this congress do not
adopt this army, before ten moons have set, New England
will have a congress of her own, which <i>will</i> adopt it, and
she will undertake the struggle <i>alone</i>&mdash;with a strong arm
and a clear conscience." This had the desired effect, and
they agreed to appoint a day.</p>

<p>The day was fixed, and came, and the army was adopted.
And now followed the question as to a commander. Mr.
Adams again rose. He proceeded to a minute delineation
of the character of General Ward, according to him merits
and honors, which then belonged to no one else; but, at the
end of this eulogy, he said: "This is not the man I have
chosen." The peculiar situation of the colonies required
another and a different man&mdash;and one from a different
quarter. These qualifications were now set forth in
strong, bold, and eloquent terms; and, in the sequel, he
said: "Gentlemen, I know these qualifications are high, but
we all know they are needful at this crisis, in this chief.
Does any one say that they are not to be obtained in the
country? I reply, they are; they reside in one of our own
body, and he is the person whom I now nominate: <span class="smcap">George
Washington</span>, of Virginia."</p>

<p>At the moment, Washington was intently gazing, as were
others, upon Mr. Adams, wrought up by an eager curiosity
for the annunciation of the name. Without a <i>suspicion</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
that it would be his own, as it transpired from the lips of the
speaker, he sprang from his seat, and rushed from the hall.</p>

<p>Samuel Adams, already in the secret, immediately
moved an adjournment of the house, in order that the
members might have time to deliberate on a nomination
so unexpected and so surprising.</p>

<p>On the 15th of June, two days only before the battle of
Bunker's hill, congress convened in the hall to decide the
important question. As individuals, they had given to the
subject a deep and solemn deliberation, commensurate with
its vital importance to the country. Until the annunciation
of Washington's name by John Adams, probably no one
had even thought of him&mdash;but <i>now</i>, but one sentiment prevailed.
He was <i>the</i> man, and their ballots <i>unanimously</i>
confirmed the choice. The delegates of Massachusetts
had other predilections; but, nobly relinquishing sectional
claims, and even partialities, they united with the others,
and rendered the choice unanimous. That was a happy
day&mdash;that a fortunate selection for America. And who can
doubt that the God by whose providence nations rise and
fall, guided that choice, with the same benign influence
which was exerted upon the prophet in a prior age of the
world, when from among his brethren he selected David
as the successor of Saul?</p>

<p>In a few days, following the appointment of Washington,
congress published a <i>manifesto</i>, setting forth to the world
the causes which had led them to take up arms. After
enumerating these causes, in a tone of manly assurance, and
yet of humble dependence upon Almighty God, they said:</p>

<p>"Our cause is just&mdash;our union is perfect&mdash;our internal
resources are great&mdash;and, if necessary, foreign assistance is
undoubtedly attainable. We gratefully acknowledge, as
signal instances of Divine favor towards us, that His providence
would not permit us to be called into this severe
controversy, until we were grown to our present strength,
had been previously exercised in warlike operations, and
possessed of the means of defending ourselves. With<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
hearts, fortified with these animating reflections, we must
most solemnly, before God and the world, declare, that,
exerting the utmost energy of those powers, which the
beneficent Creator hath graciously bestowed upon us, the
arms we have been compelled by our enemies to assume,
we will, in defiance of every hazard, with unabating firmness
and perseverance, employ for the preservation of our
liberties; being, with one mind, resolved to die freemen,
rather than to live slaves." Finally, they added: "With
an humble confidence in the mercies of the supreme and
impartial Judge and Ruler of the universe, we most
devoutly implore His divine goodness, to protect us happily
through this great conflict, to dispose our adversaries to
reconciliation on reasonable terms, and thereby relieve the
empire from the calamities of civil war."</p>

<p>The above manifesto was sent into every part of the
country, and read from the pulpits by the ministers of
religion, with suitable exhortations. In the camps of Boston,
it was read with particular solemnity. Major-General
Putnam assembled his division, upon the heights of Prospect
hill, to hear it. It was followed by a prayer, analogous
to the occasion; the general having given the signal,
all the troops cried, three times, <i>amen</i>! and, at the same
instant, the artillery of the fort fired a general salute; the
colors, recently sent to General Putnam, were seen waving
with the usual motto "<i>An appeal to Heaven</i>;" and this
other, "<i>Qui transulit sustinet</i>." The same ceremony was
observed in the other divisions. The joy and enthusiasm
were universal.</p>

<p>It may be added, in this connexion, as an evidence of the
piety of our fathers&mdash;of the belief of a superintending
providence, which characterized that generation, that congress
recommended a public fast to be observed in all the
colonies, on the 20th of July. The soldiers, they recommended
to be "humane and merciful;" and all classes of citizens,
"to humble themselves, to fast, to pray, and to implore
the Divine assistance, in this day of trouble and of peril."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span></p>

<p>Congress, in a body, attended divine services on that
day, in one of the churches of Philadelphia. Just as they
were about to enter the temple, important intelligence
was received from Georgia. It was, that that province,
which had hitherto held itself aloof from the common
cause, had joined the confederation, and had appointed five
delegates for its representation in Congress. While humbling
themselves, God was blessing and exalting them.
No news scarcely could have occasioned more joy; and
this was heightened, in consideration of the moment at
which the government and people were apprised of it.</p>

<p>Having elected a commander-in-chief, congress proceeded
to the selection of other experienced officers.&mdash;Artimas
Ward, Charles Lee, and Philip Schuyler, were
appointed major-generals, and Horatio Gates adjutant-general.
These appointments were followed, a few days after,
by that of eight brigadier-generals: Seth Pomeroy, William
Heath, and John Thomas, of Massachusetts; Richard
Montgomery, of New York; David Wooster and Joseph
Spencer, of Connecticut; John Sullivan, of New Hampshire;
and Nathaniel Greene, of Rhode Island.</p>

<p>In July, Washington, accompanied by General Lee,
repaired to the camp near Boston; receiving, on his journey
thither, the highest honors from the most distinguished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
citizens. On making a review of the army, soon after
his arrival, he found an immense multitude, of whom only
fourteen thousand five hundred were in a condition fit for
service. But even these, in respect to uniform, equipment,
and discipline, exhibited a variety most disheartening and
painful to a commander. As to discipline, it scarcely existed.
The subordinate officers were without emulation; and the
privates, having been unaccustomed to the rules and regulations
of a camp, were impatient of all subordination.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="illus-303.jpg" id="illus-303.jpg"></a>
   <img src="images/illus-303.jpg" alt="House at Cambridge where Washington resided." title="House at Cambridge where Washington resided."/>
   <p class="caption2">House at Cambridge where Washington resided.</p>
</div>

<p>Fortunately, the newly-appointed generals soon arrived,
and with great alacrity betook themselves to the task of
reform. General Gates, who was versed in the details of
military organization, exerted a powerful influence in this
salutary work. In a short period, the camp presented an
improved aspect. The soldiers became accustomed to
obedience; regulations were observed; each began to know
his duty; and, at length, instead of a mass of irregular militia,
the camp presented the spectacle of a properly-disciplined
army. It was divided into three corps: the right,
under the command of Ward, occupied Roxbury; the left,
conducted by Lee, defended Prospect hill; and the center,
which comprehended a select corps, destined for reserve,
was stationed at Cambridge, where Washington himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
had established his head-quarters. The circumvallation
was fortified by so great a number of redoubts, and supplied
with so formidable an artillery, that it had become impossible
for the besieged to assault Cambridge, and spread themselves
in the open country. It was believed, also, that they
had lost a great many men, as well upon the field of battle
as in consequence of wounds and disease.</p>

<p>Another material deficiency was the want of gunpowder.
In the depositories at Roxbury, Cambridge, and other places,
there were found to be only ninety-six barrels; the magazines
of Massachusetts contained but thirty-six more; and,
after adding to this quantity all that New Hampshire, Rhode
Island, and Connecticut could furnish, the amount fell short
of ten thousand pounds, which allowed only nine charges
to a man. In this scarcity and danger, the army remained
more than fifteen days; during which time, had the English
attacked them, they might easily have forced the lines, and
raised the siege. At length, by the exertions of the committee
of New Jersey, a few tons of powder arrived at the
camp, which supplied for the moment the necessities of the
army, and averted the evils that were feared.</p>

<p>The providing of gunpowder had now become an
important, and even an essential consideration. Accordingly,
it was recommended, by a resolution of congress,
that all the colonies should put themselves, in a state of
defence, and provide themselves with the greatest possible
number of men, of arms, and of munitions; and, especially,
that they should make diligent search for saltpetre and
sulphur. An exact scrutiny was therefore commenced,
in the cellars and in the stables, in pursuit of materials so
essential to modern war. In every part, manufactories of
gunpowder and foundries of cannon, were seen rising;
every place resounded with the preparations of war. The
provincial assemblies and conventions seconded admirably
the operations of congress; and the people obeyed, with
incredible promptitude, the orders of these various authorities.
In addition to these measures, several fast-sailing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
vessels were despatched to the coast of Guinea, where
they procured immense quantities, having purchased it of
European ships, employed in the trade. The assembly of
Massachusetts even prohibited the use of powder in shooting
at game, or its expenditure in public rejoicing.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1775, General Gage obtained leave to
repair to England; or, according to some authorities, was
rëcalled by the king. During his administration, he had
rendered himself odious to the Americans, and now they
heard of his retirement without regret. He was succeeded
in command by General William Howe, a gentleman much
esteemed for his talents, and, withal, less vindictive in his
temper.</p>

<p>Towards the close of the year, Washington was environed
with difficulties. Great responsibilities were resting
upon him, with which his means were far from being commensurate.
The organization of the army, notwithstanding
his greatest efforts, was very imperfect. The ardor of
the troops, having little excitement beyond an occasional
skirmish, was evidently abating. In not a few instances, a
spirit of rapacity had been manifested, by portions of the
troops, and depredations were made upon private as well
as public property. Several generals, dissatisfied with the
promotions made by congress, resigned their commissions,
and returned home. Sickness, especially the dysentery,
appeared in the camp, and proved a distressing visitant.
The cold weather set in, and occasioned great suffering to
the soldiers, who were destitute of barracks and other
conveniences.</p>

<p>While these and other troubles were in a degree disturbing
the calmness of Washington, other considerations did
not serve to allay his anxiety. "He knew that congress
anxiously contemplated more decisive steps, and that the
country looked for events of greater magnitude. The
public was ignorant of his actual situation, and conceived
his means, for offensive operations, to be much greater than
they were; and they expected from him the capture or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
expulsion of the British army, in Boston. He felt the
importance of securing the confidence of his countrymen,
by some brilliant action, and was fully sensible that his own
reputation was liable to suffer, if he confined himself solely
to measures of defence." To publish to his anxious country
the state of his army, would be to acquaint the enemy
with his weakness, and to hazard his destruction. The
firmness and patriotism of General Washington were displayed,
in making the good of his country an object of
higher consideration, than the applause of those who were
incapable of forming a correct opinion of the propriety of
his measures. On this, and on many other occasions during
the war, he withstood the voice of the populace, rejected
the entreaties of the sanguine, and refused to adopt the
plans of the rash, that he might ultimately secure the great
object of contention. While he resolutely rejected every
measure which, in his calm and deliberate judgment he did
not approve, he daily pondered the practicability of a successful
attack upon Boston. As a preparatory step, he took
possession of Plowed hill, Cobble hill, and Lechmere's point,
and erected fortifications upon them. These posts brought
him within half a mile of the enemy's works on Bunker's
hill, and, by his artillery, he drove the British floating-batteries
from their stations in Charles' river. He erected
floating-batteries to watch the movements of his enemy,
and to aid in any offensive operations that circumstances
might warrant. In these circumstances, he took the opinion
of his general officers, respecting an attack upon Boston;
but they unanimously gave their opinion in opposition to
the measure, and this opinion was immediately communicated
to congress. Congress appeared, however, to
favor the attempt; and, that an apprehension of danger to
the town of Boston might not have an undue influence upon
the operations of the army, resolved, 'That if General
Washington and his council of war should be of opinion
that a successful attack might be made on the troops in
Boston, he should make it in any manner he might think it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
expedient, notwithstanding the town and the property
therein might thereby be destroyed.'<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>Towards the close of February, the stock of powder
having been considerably increased, and the regular army,
which amounted to fourteen thousand men, being rëinforced
by six thousand of the militia of Massachusetts, Washington
himself was disposed to carry the war against the British
into Boston; but his general officers dissenting, he reluctantly
acquiesced, and turned his attention to the taking possession
of Dorchester heights, by which he would be able to command
the city.</p>

<p>The announcement of this intention, diffused joy throughout
the American army, and each one prepared himself to
obey the summons in case his service was required. The
night of the 4th of March, was selected for the enterprise,
in hope that a recollection of the tragic scenes of the 5th of
March, 1770, would rouse the spirit of the soldiers to a
degree commensurate with the daring exploit proposed.</p>

<p>Accordingly, on the evening of the 4th, the necessary
arrangements having been made, the Americans proceeded
in profound silence towards the peninsula of Dorchester.
The obscurity of the night was propitious, and the wind
favorable, since it could not bear to the enemy the little noise
which it was impossible to avoid. The frost had rendered
the roads easy. The batteries of Phipps' farm, and those
of Roxbury, incessantly fulminated with a stupendous roar.</p>

<p>Eight hundred men composed the van-guard; it was
followed by carriages, filled with utensils of intrenchment,
and twelve hundred pioneers led by General Thomas. In
the rear-guard were three hundred carts of fascines, of
gabions, and bundles of hay, destined to cover the flank
of the troops, in the passage of the isthmus of Dorchester,
which, being very low, was exposed to be raked on both
sides by the artillery of the English vessels.</p>

<p>"All succeeded perfectly; the Americans arrived upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
the heights, not only without being molested, but even
without being perceived by the enemy.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

   <img src="images/illus-308.jpg" alt="Fortifying Dorchester heights." title="Fortifying Dorchester heights."/>
   <p class="caption2">Fortifying Dorchester heights.</p>
</div>

<p>"They set themselves to work with an activity so prodigious,
that by ten o'clock at night, they had already constructed
two forts, in condition to shelter them from small
arms and grape-shot; one upon the height nearest to the
city, and the other upon that which looks towards Castle
island. The day appeared, but it prevented not the provincials
from continuing their works, without any movement
being made on the part of the garrison. When the latter
discovered these deeds of the Americans, nothing could
exceed their astonishment. Their only alternative, it was
at once apparent, was either to dislodge the Americans, or
abandon the town.</p>

<p>"The first intention of Howe was to attempt the former,
and preparations were made accordingly; but he was
compelled to defer the attack till the following morning.
During the night a storm arose, and when the day dawned,
the sea was still excessively agitated. A violent rain came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
to increase the obstacles; the English general kept himself
quiet. But the Americans made proper use of this delay;
they erected a third redoubt, and completed the other
works. Colonel Mifflin had prepared a great number of
hogsheads full of stones and sand, in order to roll them
upon the enemy when he should march up to the assault,
to break his ranks, and throw him into a confusion that
might smooth the way to his defeat."</p>

<p>On more mature reflection, General Howe was convinced
of the impolicy of attempting to dislodge the Americans.
If success should crown such an enterprise, it would, indeed,
be highly auspicious to the British cause, but a failure would
be fatal. The other alternative, therefore, was the only
choice left.</p>

<p>Having taken this resolution, General Howe notified the
selectmen of Boston, that the city being no longer of any
use to the king, he was resolved to abandon it; but, if
opposed, he should fire it, and for this purpose ample
materials had been provided. To these conditions it
appears, from what followed, that Washington consented;
but the articles of the truce were never written. The
Americans remained quiet spectators of the retreat of the
English. But the city presented a melancholy spectacle;
notwithstanding the orders of General Howe, all was
havoc and confusion. Fifteen hundred loyalists, with their
families and their most valuable effects, hastened, with
infinite dejection of mind, to abandon a residence which
had been so dear to them, and where they had so long
enjoyed felicity. The fathers carrying burdens, and the
mothers their children, went weeping towards the ships;
the last salutations, the farewell embraces of those who
departed and of those who remained; the sick, the wounded,
the aged, the infants, would have moved with compassion
the witnesses of their distress, if the care of their own
safety had not absorbed the attention of all.</p>

<p>"The carts and beasts of burden were become the occasion
of sharp disputes between the inhabitants, who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
retained them, and the soldiers, who wished to employ
them. The disorder was also increased by the animosity
that prevailed between the soldiers of the garrison and
those of the fleet; they reproached each other mutually,
as the authors of their common misfortune. With one
accord, however, they complained of the coldness and
ingratitude of their country, which seemed to have abandoned,
or rather forgotten them upon these distant shores,
a prey to so much misery, and to so many dangers. For,
since the month of October, General Howe had not received
from England any order or intelligence whatever, which
testified that the government still existed, and had not lost
sight of the army of Boston.</p>

<p>"Meanwhile, a desperate band of soldiers and sailors
took advantage of the confusion to force doors, and pillage
the houses and shops. They destroyed what they could
not carry away. The entire city was devoted to devastation,
and it was feared every moment that the flames would
break out to consummate its destruction.</p>

<p>"The 15th of March, General Howe issued a proclamation,
forbidding any inhabitant to go out of his house
before eleven o'clock in the morning, in order not to disturb
the embarkation of the troops, which was to have taken
place on that day. But an east wind prevented their
departure. Meanwhile, the Americans had constructed a
redoubt upon the point of Nook's hill, on the peninsula of
Dorchester; and having furnished it with artillery, they
entirely commanded the isthmus of Boston, and all the
southern part of the town. It was even to be feared that
they would occupy Noddle's island, and establish batteries,
which, sweeping the surface of the water across the harbor,
would have entirely interdicted the passage to the ships,
and reduced the garrison to the necessity of yielding at
discretion. All delay became dangerous; consequently,
the British troops and the loyalists began to embark the
17th of March, at four in the morning, and by ten, all
were on board.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span></p>

<p>"The vessels were overladen with men and baggage;
provisions were scanty, confusion was every where. The
rear-guard was scarcely out of the city, when Washington
entered it on the other side, with colors displayed, drums
beating, and all the forms of victory and triumph. He was
received by the inhabitants with every demonstration of
gratitude and respect due to a deliverer. Their joy broke
forth with the more vivacity, as their sufferings had been
long and cruel. For more than sixteen months they had
endured hunger, thirst, cold, and the outrages of an insolent
soldiery, who deemed them rebels. The most necessary
articles of food were risen to exorbitant prices.</p>

<p>"Horse flesh was not refused by those who could procure
it. For want of fuel, the pews and benches of churches
were taken up for this purpose; the counters and partitions
of warehouses were applied to the same uses, and even
houses, not inhabited, were demolished for the sake of the
wood. The English left a great quantity of artillery and
munitions. Two hundred and fifty pieces of cannon, of
different caliber, were found in Boston, in Castle island, and
in the intrenchments of Bunker's hill, and the Neck. The
English had attempted, but with little success, in their haste,
to destroy or to spike these last pieces; others had been
thrown into the sea, but they were recovered. There
were found besides, four mortars, a considerable quantity
of coal, of wheat, and of other grains, and one hundred
and fifty horses."<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>Dr. Thatcher in his 'Military Journal,' thus describes a
visit which he made to the Old South church, a few days
after the evacuation:</p>

<p>"March 23d.&mdash;I went to view the Old South church, a
spacious brick building, near the centre of the town. It
had been for more than a century consecrated to the
service of religion, and many eminent divines have in its
pulpit labored in teaching the ways of righteousness and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
truth. But, during the late siege, the inside of it was
entirely destroyed by the British, and the sacred building
occupied as a riding school for Burgoyne's regiment of
dragoons. The pulpit and pews were removed, the floor
covered with earth, and used for the purpose of training
and exercising their horses. A beautiful pew, ornamented
with carved work and silk furniture, was demolished; and by
order of an officer, the carved work, it is said, was used as
a fence for a hog-sty. The North church, a very valuable
building, was entirely demolished, and consumed for fuel.
Thus are our houses, devoted to religious worship, profaned
and destroyed by the subjects of his royal majesty. His
excellency, the commander-in-chief, has been received by
the inhabitants with every mark of respect and gratitude;
and a public dinner has been provided for him. He
requested the Rev. Dr. Elliot, at the renewal of his customary
Thursday lecture, to preach a thanksgiving sermon,
adapted to the joyful occasion. Accordingly, on the 28th,
this pious divine preached an appropriate discourse from
Isaiah xxxiii. 20, in presence of his excellency and a
respectable audience."</p>

<p>The recovery of Boston was an important event, and as
such was hailed with joyful triumph throughout the colonies.
A golden medal, commemorative of the occasion, was struck
by order of congress, and a vote of thanks was passed to
Washington and the army "for their wise and spirited conduct
in the siege and acquisition of Boston."</p>

<p>For some time previous to the winter of 1775-6, the
ultimate separation of the colonies from Great Britain must
have occurred to the leading men of America as a possible
event. But the people at large had, at that time, not only
not contemplated such an event, but would have been
startled by the proposal. The proceedings of the British
parliament, however, at length became so unjust, and even
monstrous, as to array most of the Americans against the
parent-country, and to excite a wish in the bosoms of thousands
that the colonies were free from her dominion.</p>

<p>The news of the battle of Bunker's hill not only roused
to indignation the king and his ministers, but convinced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
them that "a flock of Yankees" were not so despisable
objects as they had supposed; and that if the arms of the
Americans were not so brightly burnished as those of his
majesty's disciplined troops, nevertheless, in the firm hands
and under the practised eye of "country boors," they could
make sad havoc among them.</p>

<p>A large augmentation of the forces in America, contrary
to all previous opinion, was now deemed essential. Accordingly,
an act was introduced into parliament, authorizing
the employment of sixteen thousand German troops, which,
with the British regiments in, and about to be sent to
America, would constitute a force of nearly fifty thousand
men. The minority in parliament reprobated the employment
of mercenary troops, in strong and unmeasured terms.
But little did the friends of America in parliament feel, in
view of such a step, compared with the Americans themselves.
"Arm foreigners against us!" they exclaimed;
"let us treat the English themselves as foreigners. Better
for us to be eternally separated from them, than to be
exposed to such cruelty." But the indignation of the
Americans was, if possible, still more increased by another
act of parliament, passed at the same session, viz: "prohibiting
all <i>trade</i> and <i>commerce</i> with the colonies; and
authorizing the <i>capture</i> and <i>condemnation</i>, not only of all
American vessels with their cargoes, but all other vessels
<i>found trading</i>, in any port or place in the colonies, as if
the same were the vessels and effects of <i>open enemies</i>; and
the vessels and property thus taken were vested in the
captors, and the crews were to be treated, not as prisoners,
but as <i>slaves</i>." By another clause, British subjects were
authorized to compel men taken on board of American
vessels, whether crews or <i>other persons</i>, to fight against
<i>their own countrymen</i>!</p>

<p>By such measures, cruel and impolitic, did the British
authorities <i>compel</i> the Americans, not only to take up arms
against the mother-country, but to desire a lasting separation
from her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus the leaven commenced, and by degrees diffused
itself through the mass. Shortly after, the gazettes began
to speak out. These were followed by the issue of several
pamphlets; among which, that entitled <i>Common Sense</i>, by
Thomas Paine, "produced a wonderful effect in the different
colonies in favor of independence." Influential individuals
in every colony urged it as a step absolutely necessary, to
preserve the rights and liberties, as well as to secure the
happiness and prosperity of America. Reconciliation, they
said, on any terms compatible with the preservation and
security of these great and important objects, was now
impossible. These sentiments were disseminated among
the people by distinguished individuals, in a variety of
ways. The chief justice of South Carolina, William
Henry Dayton, appointed under the new form of government,
just adopted, in his charge to the grand jurors, in
April, after justifying the proceedings of that colony, in
forming a new government, on the principles of the revolution
in England, in 1688, thus concludes: "The Almighty
created America to be independent of Great Britain: let us
beware of the impiety of being backward to act as instruments
in the Almighty's hand, now extended to accomplish
his purpose; and by the completion of which alone, America,
in the nature of human affairs, can be secure against the crafty
and insidious designs of her enemies, who think her power
and prosperity already far too great. In a word, our piety
and political safety are so blended, that to refuse our labors
in this divine work, is to refuse to be a great, a free, a pious,
and a happy people." This was bold language for one so
prominent to utter. In the view of royalists, it was treasonable;
but in the estimation of the true friends of American
liberty, if bold, it was just and patriotic.</p>

<p>At length, the question of independence entered some of
the colonial assemblies and conventions, and expressions in
favor of such a measure were made. North Carolina, it
is believed, has the honor of taking the lead, as a <i>province</i>,
having by her convention, as early as April 22d, empowered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
their delegates in congress, "to concur with those in the
other colonies in declaring independency."<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>On the 15th of May the convention of Virginia went still
further, and unanimously <i>instructed</i> their delegates in the
general congress, "to propose to that respectable body, to
declare the united colonies free and independent states,
absolved from all allegiance or dependence upon the
crown or parliament of Great Britain; and to give the
<i>assent</i> of that colony to such declaration." During the
same month, Massachusetts and Rhode Island virtually
adopted similar resolutions. In short, public sentiment
appeared to be setting strongly in favor of action, on this
great and momentous question.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, congress were not idle or uninterested
spectators of events. They had been watching with no
small solicitude the "signs of the times." Personally,
they had counted the cost. Most of the members had
come to the conclusion that rather than be slaves, as
they had been, they would sacrifice fortune and life itself.
These, therefore, they were willing to peril, by any act or
declaration which might seem to contribute to their
country's cause.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span></p>
<p>But a sacred regard to that cause, required the utmost
prudence. Premature action might injure a cause which
they wished, above all others, to benefit. The popular
feelings must have become duly interested&mdash;the popular
will must <i>precede</i> and <i>direct</i>.</p>

<p>At length, the propitious time was believed to have
arrived, and in humble dependence upon the guidance and
protection of Almighty God, it was determined to go forward
with this great and solemn work.</p>

<p>On the 7th of June, therefore, the great question of
independence was brought directly before congress, by
Richard Henry Lee, one of the delegates from Virginia.
He submitted a resolution, declaring "that the united colonies
are, and ought to be, free and independent states; that
they are absolved from all allegiance to the British crown;
and that all political connection between them and Great
Britain is, and ought to be, dissolved." The resolution was
postponed until the next day, and every member enjoined
to attend, to take the same into consideration. On the 8th,
it was debated in committee of the whole.</p>

<p>No question of greater magnitude was ever presented to
the consideration of a deliberative body, or debated with
more eloquence, energy, and ability. Every member
seemed duly impressed with the important bearing that
their decision would have upon the future destiny of the
country.</p>

<p>Mr. Lee, the mover, and Mr. John Adams were particularly
distinguished in supporting, and Mr. John Dickinson
in opposing the resolution. On the 10th, it was adopted in
committee, by a bare majority of the colonies. The delegates
from Pennsylvania and Maryland, were instructed to
oppose it; and the delegates from some of the other colonies
were without special instructions on the subject. To
give time for greater unanimity, the resolution was postponed
in the house, until the first of July. In the mean
time, a committee, consisting of Mr. Jefferson, John Adams,
Dr. Franklin, Mr. Sherman, and R. R. Livingston, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
appointed to prepare a declaration of independence. During
this interval, measures were taken to procure the assent
of all the colonies.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>A portion of the colonies had not given specific instructions
to their delegates, while others had, and in opposition to the
measure. On a question of such magnitude, it was deemed
of the utmost importance that entire unanimity, if possible,
should be had. The delegates of New York dispatched
an express to the convention of that colony, then in session,
for advice; but the convention, not considering themselves
or their delegates authorized to declare the colony independent,
recommended that the people, who were then
about to elect new members to the convention, should give
instructions on the subject. June 15th, New Hampshire
instructed her delegates to join the other colonies on this
question. On the 14th, Connecticut gave similar instructions.
New Jersey followed on the 21st. Pennsylvania,
the same month, removed restrictions which in the previous
November, had been laid upon their delegates, and now
authorized them to unite in the measure. Maryland had
also instructed her delegates to vote against independence;
but on the 28th of June, following the example of Pennsylvania,
the members of this convention rëcalled their former
instructions, and empowered their delegates to concur.
These new instructions were immediately dispatched by
express to Philadelphia, and, on 1st of July, were laid
before congress.</p>

<p>On the same day, the resolution of Mr. Lee, relating to
independence, was resumed in that body, referred to a
committee of the whole, and was assented to by all the
colonies, except Pennsylvania and Delaware.</p>

<p>The delegates from the former, then present, were seven,
and four voted against it. The number present from
Delaware, was only two&mdash;Thomas McKean and George
Read&mdash;and they were divided; McKean in favor, and Read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
against the resolution. Being reported to the house, at
the request of a colony, the proposition was postponed until
the next day, when it passed, and was entered on the
journals. The declaration of independence was reported
by the special committee on the 28th of June, and on the
4th of July, came before congress for final decision, and
received the vote of every colony.</p>

<p>Two of the members from Pennsylvania, Morris and
Dickinson, were absent; of the five who were present,
Franklin, Wilson, and Morton, were in favor, and Willing
and Humphrey against. Mr. McKean, to secure the vote
of Delaware, sent an express for Mr. Rodney, the other
delegate from that colony; who, although at the distance of
eighty miles from Philadelphia, arrived in time on the 4th
to unite with him in the vote, and thus complete the union
of the colonies on this momentous question. The committee
appointed to prepare a declaration of independence,
selected Mr. Adams and Mr. Jefferson a sub-committee;
and the original draft was made by Mr. Jefferson.</p>

<p>This draft, without any amendment by the committee, was
reported to congress, and after undergoing several amendments,
received their sanction.</p>

<p>It now only remained to affix their signatures to the
declaration, and to publish it to the world, and their duty,
in respect to this important measure, was done. Having been
engrossed on parchment, it was brought out, and laid on the
table. This was on the 2d of August. Meanwhile, some
who had voted for the declaration, had left congress,
and others had taken their places. The latter signed the
instrument.</p>

<p>John Hancock, as president of the congress, led the way.
Taking a pen, he recorded his name. He wrote with great
power, and on the original parchment, no signature is so
bold and full-faced as his. The others followed by states&mdash;fifty-six
in number.</p>

<p>The declaration of independence, was the great act of
the Revolution. It was the hinge on which turned the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
important events which followed. Yet, at the period the
plan was brought forward, it appeared to many to partake
of the wildness and extravagance of some measure of the
knight of la Mancha. At that day, the colonies were few and
feeble. They had no political character&mdash;no bond of union
but common sufferings, common necessities, and common
danger. The inhabitants did not exceed three millions&mdash;they
had no veteran army&mdash;no arsenals but barns&mdash;no
munitions of war&mdash;few fortifications&mdash;no public treasury, no
power to lay taxes, and no credit on which to obtain a loan.</p>

   <img src="images/illus-320.jpg" alt="John Hancock." title="John Hancock."/>
   <p class="caption2">John Hancock.</p>
</div>

<p>No wonder that the hearts of some trembled. No
wonder that many doubted the expediency of such a bold
and adventurous step. Who was the nation with which
the colonies had to contend?&mdash;the mistress of the world&mdash;a
nation whose navy far exceeded that of any other nation
on the globe. Her armies were numerous and veteran&mdash;her
officers were skilful and practised&mdash;her statesmen subtle
and sagacious, and were now fired with indignation.</p>

<p>All these circumstances were well known to the patriots<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
who composed the congress of '76. They were aware that
they put in peril life, liberty, and country.</p>

<p>Yet, they well knew the importance of the measure proposed,
and not only its importance, but its necessity. The
country needed some great object distinctly before them.
The colonies required a bond of union&mdash;a common cause&mdash;one
expressed&mdash;recorded&mdash;recognised&mdash;some one great
plan, the object of which they could pledge their lives,
fortunes, and sacred honor, to secure. That plan was
independence.</p>

<p>The influence of the declaration was immediately perceived&mdash;it
roused the nation to a higher tone of feeling,
and gave impulse and concentration to the national energies.
It helped on the tide of Revolution, and mightily aided in
driving back the waves of British oppression. But the full
influence of that measure is not yet felt&mdash;is not yet seen.
That belongs to distant time. Some day, hereafter, it will
stand out in the great picture of human liberty, in all its
grandeur and importance. More will be thought of it than
of the splendid and long-lauded achievements of Marathon
and Salamis&mdash;of Waterloo and Trafalgar!</p>

<p>Nor can we yet estimate the greatness of the <i>men</i>. We
are still too near them. But they are rising higher and
higher, every year that passes. As we retire into the
distance from the date and scene of their actions, their
magnitude and worth acquire their true and proper dimensions.
In stern and self-denying virtue, they will compare
with Regulus, and in a pure and lofty patriotism, will be
placed on the same roll with William Tell and Robert
the Bruce.</p>

<p>The signers of the declaration of American independence,
and their compatriots in toil, and trial, and blood, will never
be forgotten. They <i>need</i> no monument, but they <i>deserve</i>
one; and, for myself, I wish there was one&mdash;a <i>Revolutionary
monument</i>&mdash;erected by the nation&mdash;worthy of the
empire whose liberties, civil and religious, they secured&mdash;one
which should stand&mdash;if God pleased&mdash;through all time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
to serve as a consecrated offering to their patriotism, and
the evidence of their imperishable glory:&mdash;a monument
to which we might conduct our sons in future days; and,
as they pondered the deeply engraved names of these
heroes and martyrs to liberty&mdash;we, the fathers, might say,
"<i>Look upon your ancestry, and scorn to be slaves</i>!"</p>

<p>What a day is the 4th of July, as it yearly recurs! The
cannon on that day thunders from our hills&mdash;but it speaks
of liberty. The bell from every spire sends forth its peal,
but in sounds which impart a joyous impulse to the blood
of the sire, and awaken a thrill of delight in the bosom of
the stripling.</p>

<p>No other nation ever celebrated such a day. Days of
joy and jubilee they have had; but they were days which,
while they removed one usurper from the throne, made
way for another; or celebrated some ambitious hero's
victories, achieved at the expense of slaughtered thousands.
Is it the spirit of an unholy triumph, which prompts the
Americans to dwell with delight upon the day? Patriotic
sympathy would hail with joy such a day, for any nation
on the globe. And such a day, we trust, will come for all;
when the sun of liberty, which warms and refreshes us,
will fill with joy even the vassals of the Russian autocrat,
and spread his heart-cheering beams over the tyrannized
millions of the misnamed "celestial empire."</p>

<p>It has sometimes been cast upon us as a reproach, that
we exalt the day too much. Exalt it too much! It has
indeed sometimes been abused. The spirit of liberty has
grown wanton, and excess has sullied the irreproachable
propriety, which should ever characterize the demonstrations
of joy on such a day as this. But those days are
chiefly passed. No&mdash;whence the charge of exalting the
day too highly?&mdash;Not by those who have tasted the sweets
of American liberty, nor by those who have drawn long
and deep draughts from the refreshing fountains of western
freedom. Oh, no&mdash;not by such; but by the hirelings of
some eastern usurper&mdash;by the myrmidons of crowned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
heads, who hate a day which speaks so loudly of rational
liberty to the rest of the world in bondage.</p>

<p>What monarch in Europe would think his throne safe,
were his subjects to witness an American celebration of the
4th of July? It would open visions before them upon
which they would gaze with intense emotions. It would
excite pantings after liberty, which, if unresisted, would
convulse every nation, and demolish every despotic throne.
What would the Russian serf say, were he to look in upon
the smiling faces which course the streets of a New England
village, on a bright and balmy 4th of July? What
would the subjects of Algerine or Turkish despotism say?</p>

<p>Yet we exalt the day too much! But for that day, what
would have been our present condition? Where would have
been that constitution, under which our political voyage
of more than sixty years has been made with so much
prosperity to the nation? Where were that enterprise
which has levelled our forests, and spread a smiling and
happy population over our western wilds? Where that
inventive genius, which, in its creations, has rivalled, and
in some respects excelled, the inventions of Europe? Look
at our ships&mdash;our manufactures&mdash;our printing establishments&mdash;our
cities&mdash;our canals&mdash;our railroads&mdash;our thousand and
ten thousand sources of wealth and happiness&mdash;where had
these been, but for the 4th of July, 1776, connected as it
was, and must ever be, with the achievement of our national
independence? Would Great Britain have suffered these?
Would she have seen such thrift&mdash;such expansion&mdash;such
accumulation of national power, and not have repressed
it&mdash;when she could not bear, without passing prohibitory
laws, that our forefather's should make a hat to cover their
heads&mdash;or manufacture a sheet of paper on which to write
a letter to a friend! Had the mother-country had her will,
where had been the genius of Fulton, Whitney, and Clinton?
On the other side of the waters&mdash;not on this. Our halls of
legislature would have failed in the manly eloquence of
rival orators, and our temples of worship would have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
devoted to God <i>and</i> the aggrandizement of a phalanx of
spiritual lords.</p>

<p>Said a patriarch and apostle of liberty, just after the vote
on the question of independence had been taken&mdash;"Let the
day be commemorated as the day of deliverance, by solemn
acts of devotion to God. Let it be solemnized with pomp,
guns, bells, bonfires, and illuminations, from one end of the
continent to the other, from this time forward for ever."</p>

<p>The patriarch uttered noble and patriotic sentiments.
Be the day remembered now and for ever. Remember it,
<i>fathers</i>, as connected with the civil and religious blessings,
which have been your portion in your earthly pilgrimage.
Remember it, <i>mothers</i>, for it has made you the wives and
companions of freemen. Remember it <i>sons</i> and <i>daughters</i>,
as the birth-day of liberty, but for which you might be
shedding your blood in the service of a tyrant, or staining
your virtue in the embraces of a bachanalian.</p>

<p>Be it remembered&mdash;and as it recurs&mdash;and may it recur
with every year while time shall last&mdash;first and foremost
let the tribute of a devout homage ascend to the GOD of
our fathers&mdash;to <span class="smcap">Him</span>, who imparted wisdom to their counsel
and success to their arms&mdash;who, when darkness encircled
them, dispelled it&mdash;when stores failed, supplied them&mdash;who
was a pillar of cloud by day, and a pillar of fire by night&mdash;to
Him be glory for a land like that which the patriarch
saw from Pisgah&mdash;and whose hills are like those of Lebanon
and Carmel.</p>

<p>The day is becoming a <i>religious festival</i>. This is right.
Let the sanctuary be opened, and homage be offered there.
Let our Sabbath-schools assemble, and fill our groves with
divine song. But never should we dispense with other
innocent demonstrations of joy. Let the cannon thunder
from our hills&mdash;let the bells peal through our villages and
through our vallies. In every appropriate way, let the
future generations celebrate that glad era in our history
when British cohorts were obliged to retire, and "God save
the king" on the rolling drum, died upon our shores.</p>

<p>The successful defence of Fort Moultrie, on Sullivan's
island, is justly considered one of the noblest achievements
recorded in the annals of the Revolution.</p>

<p>The reduction of the southern colonies to obedience, was
deemed a measure of prime importance by the British
government, nor was it considered a project of difficult
achievement. Hitherto the principal theatre of the war
had been in the north; and, hence, it was calculated that
preparations for the defence of the southern colonies had
been so much neglected, that little more than a demonstration
in that quarter would be necessary to bring the people
to terms.</p>

<p>Early in 1776, an expedition having the above object in
view was devised, the command of which was entrusted to
Sir Peter Parker and Earl Cornwallis. Accordingly, on
the 3d of May, Admiral Parker, with twenty sail, arrived
at Cape Fear, with Generals Cornwallis, Vaughan, and
several others.</p>

<p>General Clinton was expected from New York, with
another considerable corps, to cöoperate in the attack.
With his troops he had arrived at the point of destination,
even anterior to the naval armament; and, being the senior
general, on the junction of the forces, assumed the command.
The immediate object was the reduction and possession
of Charleston, the capital of South Carolina; on
the fall of which, the subjugation of that and the other
southern provinces would be an easy achievement.</p>

<p>The meditated invasion was not unknown to the Carolinians,
who, being a high-minded and chivalrous people,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
determined that if their capital fell, it should be at an
expense of a treasure of British blood.</p>

<p>With great activity and energy, therefore, they betook
themselves to the fortification of every assailable point.
With patriotic disinterestedness, the citizens demolished their
valuable store-houses on the wharves to supply materials
for defence. Streets were barricaded, and intrenchments
erected along the shore. Even windows were stripped of
their weights, to supply the demand for bullets. The
inhabitants generally came to the work of defence, and
scarcely a man on the ground could be discovered without
a spade, a pickaxe, or other implement of work. Even
the blacks from the city, and for miles in the country, were
employed, and seemed animated with the enthusiasm and
zeal of their masters. The commanding general was
Major-general Lee, who, having been appointed by congress
to the command of the southern forces, and possessing
the entire confidence of the troops and of the people, was
enabled to carry to completion the various works of defence,
which his knowledge and skill had decided to be important.
Governor Rutledge, also a man of great influence in the
province, cöoperated with General Lee, in all his measures
of defence, and by his example and exhortations essentially
contributed to the happy results which followed.</p>

<p>At the distance of six miles from the point of land formed
by the confluence of the two rivers, Ashley and Cooper,
and on which Charleston is built, lies <i>Sullivan's island</i>. It
commands the channel which leads to the port. The due
fortification of this point was a matter of great moment.
The outline of a fort had already been marked out, to complete
which, Colonel William Moultrie, a singularly brave
and accomplished officer, was dispatched early in March.
Palmetto trees, which from their soft and spongy texture,
were admirably calculated to deprive a ball of its impetus
without causing splinters, had been cut in the forest, and
the logs in huge rafts lay moored to the beach. "Ignorant
of gunnery, but confident in their own resources, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
nerved with resolute courage, Moultrie and his coadjutors,
hardy sons of the soil, heaved those huge logs from the
water, and began the work. A square pen was built, with
bastions from each angle, capable of covering a thousand
men. The logs were laid in two parallel rows, and sixteen
feet apart; bound together with cross-timbers dove-tailed
and bolted into logs, and the wide space filled with sand.
When completed, it presented the appearance of a solid
wall, sixteen feet wide; but its strength was yet to be
tested. Behind this, Moultrie placed four hundred and
thirty-five men, and thirty-one cannon, some of them
twenty-sixes, some eighteens, and the rest of smaller
caliber&mdash;throwing in all five hundred and thirteen pounds.</p>

<p>"It was at this juncture that Lee arrived from the north,
and took command of the troops. When his eye, accustomed
to the scientific structures of Europe, fell on this
rudely-built affair, he smiled in derision, calling it a
'<i>slaughter-pen</i>,' and requested Governor Rutledge to have
it immediately evacuated. But that noble patriot was
made of sterner stuff, and replied, 'that while a soldier
remained alive, he would never give his sanction to such
an order.'"</p>

<p>The naval force of the British, consisted of the Bristol
and Experiment, of fifty guns; four frigates, the Active, the
Acteon, the Solebay, and the Syren, of twenty-eight; the
Sphynx, of twenty, the Friendship, of twenty-two, two
smaller vessels of eight, and the Thunder, a bomb-ketch.
On reaching the bar, at the entrance of the channels of
Charleston, it was found that the fifty-gun ships could not
pass without being lightened. The removal and rëplacement
of their guns was attended with incredible labor; and
although thus lightened, they struck, and for a time were in
danger of bilging.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, General Clinton issued his proclamation,
which he dispatched to the city with a flag, demanding the
citizens to lay down their arms, and to return to their
allegiance, on pain of an immediate attack, and an utter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
overthrow. To this demand, not even the civility of a
reply was accorded, and the threatened attack, on the
morning of the 28th of June, was commenced.</p>

<p>To the citizens of Charleston those were anxious hours.
There was hope, but more of fear. They filled the wharves,
the roofs, and the steeples&mdash;in short, every eminence was
black with spectators, gazing on the exciting scene and
the approaching conflict.</p>

<p>It was a calm, bright, beautiful day. The wind being
fair, the British fleet came steadily, proudly, towards the
"slaughter-pen," and one after another took the positions
assigned them. The Americans watched them with intense
interest&mdash;"Moultrie's eye flashed with delight." Every
gun was loaded&mdash;every one was manned&mdash;and all were
now anxiously waiting the order to fire. At length, a portion
of the fleet had reached point-blank-shot distance,
when Moultrie, who, like Prescott at the battle of Bunker's
hill, had restrained his anxiously-waiting men, now gave
the word of command "<i>Fire!</i>"&mdash;And they did fire&mdash;and
"the shores shook with the tremendous explosion."</p>

<p>The fleet continued to advance, a little abreast of the fort,
when letting go their anchors, and clewing up their sails,
they opened upon the fort. More than a hundred cannon!&mdash;their
blaze, their smoke, their roar&mdash;all in the same
instant&mdash;it was a terrible commencement&mdash;the stoutest
heart palpitated! every one unconsciously held his breath!</p>

<p>"The battle had now fairly commenced, and the guns
were worked with fearful rapidity. It was one constant
peal of thunder, and to the spectators in Charleston, that
low spot, across the bay, looked like a volcano breaking
forth from the sea. Lee stood on Haddrell's point, watching
the effect of the first fire. When the smoke lifted, like
the folds of a vast curtain, he expected to see that 'slaughter-pen'
in fragments; but there still floated the flag of freedom,
and beneath it beat brave hearts, to whom that awful cannonade
was but 'a symphony to the grand march of independence.'
When the fight had fairly begun, they thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
no more of those heavy guns than they did of their rifles.
Their coats were hastily flung one side, and their hats with
them&mdash;and in their shirt-sleeves, with handkerchiefs about
their heads, they toiled away under the sweltering sun with
the coolness and courage of old soldiers. The fire from
those nine vessels, with their cannon all trained upon that
pile of logs, was terrific, and it trembled like a frightened
thing under the shock; but the good palmettoes closed
silently over the balls, as they buried themselves in the
timber and sand, and the work went bravely on. Thus,
hour after hour, did it blaze, and flame, and thunder there
on the sea, while the shots of the Americans told with
murderous effect. At every discharge, those vessels shook
as if smitten by a rock&mdash;the planks were ripped up, the
splinters hurled through the air, and the decks strewed
with mangled forms. Amid the smoke, bombs were seen
traversing the air, and dropping, in an incessant shower,
within the fort&mdash;but a morass in the middle swallowed them
up as fast as they fell. At length, riddled through and
through, her beds of mortar broken up, the bomb-vessel
ceased firing. Leaving the smaller vessels, as unworthy of
his attention, Moultrie trained his guns upon the larger ones,
and 'Look to the Commodore! look to the fifty-gun ship!'
passed along the lines, and they <i>did</i> look to the Commodore
in good earnest, sweeping her decks at every discharge
with such fatal fire, that at one time there was
scarcely a man left upon the quarter-deck. The Experiment,
too, came in for her share of consideration&mdash;her decks
were slippery with blood, and nearly a hundred of her men
were borne below, either killed or wounded. Nor were the
enemy idle, but rained back a perfect tempest of balls; but
that brave garrison had got used to the music of cannon,
and the men, begrimed with powder and smoke, shot with
the precision and steadiness they would have done in firing
at a target. As a heavy ball, in full sweep, touched the
top of the works, it took one of the coats, lying upon the
logs, and lodged it in a tree. 'See that coat! see that coat!'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
burst in a laugh on every side, as if it had been a mere plaything
that had whistled past their heads. Moultrie, after a
while, took out his pipe, and lighting it, leaned against the
logs, and smoked away with his officers, as if they were
out there sunning themselves, instead of standing within
the blaze, and smoke, and uproar of nearly two hundred
cannon. Now and then he would take the pipe from his
mouth to shout '<i>fire!</i>' or give some order, and then commence
puffing and talking&mdash;thus presenting a strange mixture
of the droll and heroic. The hearts of the spectators
in the distance, many of whom had husbands and brothers
in the fight, were far more agitated than they against whom
that fearful iron storm was hailing.</p>

<p>"After the fight had continued for several hours, Lee,
seeing that the 'slaughter pen' held out so well, passed over
to it in a boat, and remained for a short time. Accustomed
as he was to battle, and to the disciplined valor of European
troops, he still was struck with astonishment at the
scene that presented itself as he approached. There stood
Moultrie, quietly smoking his pipe, while the heavy and
rapid explosions kept up a deafening roar; and there, stooping
over their pieces, were those raw gunners firing with
the deadly precision of practised artillerists. Amazed to
find an English fleet, carrying two hundred and sixty guns,
kept at bay by thirty cannon and four hundred men, he left
the fort to its brave commander, and returned to his old
station."<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>Among the Americans, who were that day in the
"slaughter-pen," and who were dealing death and destruction
without stint, was a Sergeant Jasper, whose name has
since been given to one of the counties in Georgia, for this
and other heroic deeds. In the warmest of the contest, the
flag-staff of the fort was shot away by a cannon-ball, and
fell to the outside of the ramparts on the beach. The spectators
at Charleston saw it fall, and supposing that the fort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
had yielded, were filled with consternation and dismay. In
the surrender of the fort, they read the destiny of themselves
and city. But what was their joy to perceive that
columns of smoke, from the fort, still continued to roll up&mdash;the
blaze and thunder of its cannon continued to be seen
and heard; and presently the folds of the flag again fluttered
in the breeze. Sergeant Jasper was the hero of the
occasion. He had witnessed the fall of the flag&mdash;and he
saw it "stretched in dishonor on the sand." It was a perilous
attempt, but he did not hesitate. Leaping the ramparts,
he proceeded, amidst a shower of balls, the entire length
of the fort, and, picking up the flag, tied it to a post, and
rëplaced it on a parapet, and there, too, he himself supported
it till another flag-staff could be procured. Here,
once more, it proudly waved&mdash;amid the shouts and congratulations
of the now still more courageous in the fort,
and to the joy of still more distant and equally anxious
spectators of the scene.</p>

   <p class="caption2">Sergeant Jasper replanting the Flag at Fort Moultrie.</p>
</div>

<p>About this time, another circumstance sent a momentary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
panic through the stern hearts of the defenders of the fort.
The ammunition was failing, and a large force, which had
effected a landing, was in rapid march to storm the works.
Moultrie instantly dispatched Marion to a sloop-of-war for
a supply, and another message to Governor Rutledge at
Charleston. Both were successful&mdash;both in season. Said
the governor, in a note accompanying five hundred pounds
of powder, "Do not make too free with your cannon&mdash;<i>cool,
and do mischief</i>."</p>

<p>With this fresh supply of ammunition, the fire, which had
been relaxed, was redoubled. The British were astounded.
They had congratulated themselves, upon the partial suspension
of firing, that the fort was about to yield. But the
new fury of the firing, on the part of the Americans, soon
served to convince them of their error. They also redoubled
their efforts, and, for a time, the contest was more terrible
than ever. "Once," it is said, "the broadsides of four
vessels exploded together, and when the balls struck the
fort, it trembled in every timber and throughout its entire
extent, and shook as if about to fall in pieces."</p>

<p>The day was now wearing away, and still the contest was
undecided. The British, reluctant to relinquish an object
which in the morning they imagined so easily won, still
continued the heavy cannonade; while the Americans,
gathering strength and courage by what they had already
accomplished, stood firm and undaunted. At length, the
sun went down behind the distant shore, and darkness
threw its ample folds on every object of nature. But now,
through the darkness, flames shot forth and thunders rolled,
presenting a scene of solemn and indescribable grandeur.
The inhabitants of Charleston still lingered on their watchtowers,
gazing out through the gloom towards the spot
where the battle was still raging in its fiercest intensity.</p>

<p>But they were not destined to hope and pray in vain.
At about half-past nine, the fire from the English fleet
suddenly ceased. They had fought long&mdash;fought with all
the ardor and enthusiasm of friends to their king and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
cause. But they had fought in vain. Victory decided for
Moultrie and his patriot band, and it only remained for the
English to withdraw, as well as they were able, their ships,
which had been nearly disabled, and their crews, which had
been dreadfully reduced.</p>

<p>"The loss of the Americans, in this gallant action," says
the writer whom we have already quoted, "was slight,
amounting to only thirty-six, both killed and wounded,
while that of the British, according to their own accounts,
was a hundred and sixty. Double the number would probably
be nearer the truth. The commander had his arm
carried away. One is surprised that so few of the garrison
were killed, when it is remembered that nearly ten
thousand shots and shells were fired by the enemy that day.
The Acteon, during the action, went aground, and the next
morning a few shots were fired at her, when a party was
sent to take possession of her. The crew, however, setting
fire to her, pushed off. When the Americans got on board,
they turned two or three of the guns on the fugitives, but,
finding the flames approaching the magazine, abandoned the
vessel. For a short time, she stood a noble spectacle, with
her tall masts wreathed in flame, and black hull crackling
and blazing below. But when the fire reached the powder,
there suddenly shot up a huge column of smoke, spreading
like a tree at the top, under the pressure of the atmosphere&mdash;and
then the ill-fated vessel lifted heavily from the water,
and fell back in fragments, with an explosion that was
heard for miles around."</p>

<p>A few days following the battle, the fort was visited by
Governor Rutledge and many of the distinguished ladies
and gentlemen of Charleston. They came to see the old
"slaughter-pen," which had so nobly withstood the attack
under such long-practiced and accomplished officers as
Parker, Clinton, and Cornwallis. Ample praises were
bestowed upon the "rough-and-ready" soldiers, while mutual
congratulations were exchanged with Moultrie and his
brave associates in command. Nor was the gallant Jasper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
forgotten. Taking from his side his sword, Governor Rutledge
buckled it on the daring soldier, as a reward for his
noble exploit. Following this, the accomplished Mrs.
Elliot presented a pair of elegant colors to the regiment
under Moultrie and Motte, with the following brief, but
beautiful address: "The gallant behavior in defence of
liberty and your country, entitle you to the highest honor;
accept, then, two standards, as a reward justly due to your
regiment; and I make not the least doubt, under Heaven's
protection, you will stand by them as long as they can
wave in the air of liberty."</p>

<p>The colors thus presented to Colonel Moultrie were, at a
subsequent date, carried by him to <i>Savannah</i>, and were
displayed during the assault against that place. Two
officers were killed, while attempting to place them upon
the enemy's parapet at the Spring-hill redoubt. Just
before the retreat, Jasper, while endeavoring to rëplace
them upon the works, received a mortal wound. When a
retreat was ordered, he recollected the honorable condition
upon which the donor presented them to his regiment, and
among the last acts of his life, he succeeded in bringing
them off.</p>

<p>To Major Horry, who called to see him a little while
before his death, he said: "Major, I have got my furlough.
That sword was presented to me by Governor Rutledge,
for my services in defence of Fort Moultrie; give it to my
father, and tell him I have worn it with honor. If he should
weep, tell him his son died in hope of a better life. Tell
Mrs. Elliot that I lost my life supporting the colors which
she presented to our regiment."</p>

<p>Such was the affair at Fort Moultrie&mdash;such the patriotic
and chivalrous conduct of men fighting for their altars,
their homes, their wives, their children. Was it strange
that, in a good cause, Heaven should smile on such high
and heroic conduct? Was it strange that a people, so
intent on the enjoyment of their just rights, should accomplish
their object?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span></p>

<p>This repulse of the British, it may be added, was unexpected
to them; and the more so, as they well knew that
no systematic measure of defence had been adopted at the
South. The contest had hitherto been in a different quarter,
and no intimations had transpired of a contemplated
change. In addition to this, the British were profoundly
ignorant of the true southern character. They had learned
some lessons in regard to the "Yankees;" and, especially,
that if they were made of "stuff," it was "stern stuff;" but
they had yet to learn, that the same kind of ore abounded
south of the Potomac. The old "slaughter-pen" on Sullivan's
Island, <i>enlightened</i> them, and <i>impressed</i> them as to
the fact so fully, that the influence of the lesson lasted for
two years and a half&mdash;that being the respite of the Southern
states from the calamities of war, consequent upon the
repulse of the British at Fort Moultrie.</p>

<p>From the commencement of hostilities to the evacuation
of Boston by the British, the cause of the Americans had
appeared to be specially favored by Heaven. In their
several engagements, if they had not achieved decided
victories, the <i>effect</i> of them was such as to inspire confidence,
to diffuse through the colonies an unabated ardor,
and the most lively anticipations of ultimate and not far-distant
triumph. A season of sad reverse, and consequent
dejection, however, was appointed for them, perhaps to
teach them more entire dependence upon Divine Providence,
and to enhance the value of a final conquest, when
it should arrive, and which, though distant, was still in
reserve for them.</p>

<p>On the retirement of the British fleet from Boston,
Washington was left to conjecture its destination. Apprehending,
however, a hostile attempt upon New York, he
had, before their departure, detached a considerable force
for the protection of that important post. The main army
soon followed, and, on the 14th of April, entered the city.
Measures were immediately adopted to place it in a state
of defence.</p>

<p>Contrary to the expectations of Washington, the British
fleet, on leaving the waters of Boston, directed its course
to Halifax, at which place rëinforcements from England
were expected by Sir William Howe. Disappointed, however,
in this latter respect, and finding provisions for his
troops scarce, he resolved on sailing for New York.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 2d of July, he took possession of Staten Island.
The inhabitants of the island received the English general
with great demonstrations of joy. The soldiers being
quartered about in the villages, found, in abundance, the
refreshments of which they were in the greatest need.
Here General Howe was visited by Governor Tryon, who
gave him precise information with respect to the state of
the province, as also with regard to the forces and preparations
of the enemy. Many inhabitants of New Jersey
came to offer themselves to be enrolled for the royal service;
even those of Staten Island were forward to enlist
under the English standard; every thing announced that
the army had only to show itself in the provinces to be
assured of a prompt victory. Admiral Howe, after touching
at Halifax, where he found dispatches from his brother,
who urged him to come and join him at New York, made
sail again immediately, and landed, without accident, at
Staten Island, the 12th of July. General Clinton arrived
about the same time, with the troops he rëconducted from
the unfortunate expedition against Charleston. Commodore
Hotham also appeared, with the rëinforcements under his
escort; so that in a short time the army amounted to about
twenty-four thousand men&mdash;English, Hessians, and Waldekers.
Several regiments of Hessian infantry were
expected to arrive shortly, when the army would be carried
to the number of thirty-five thousand combatants, of
the best troops of Europe. America had never seen such
a display of forces.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>The Americans, on their part, meanwhile, had made
every effort in their power to resist the danger to their
cause, menaced by so formidable a force. The militia of
the neighboring provinces, and a few regular regiments
from Maryland, from Pennsylvania, and New England, had
been called in, by which several augmentations the American
force had been nominally raised to twenty-seven thousand.
One-fourth part of these, however, were disabled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
by sickness, and nearly an equal number were destitute of
arms, leaving but about fourteen thousand and five hundred
effective men. Among so heterogeneous a force, collected
in a time of danger and excitement, there existed little
opportunity to introduce order and discipline. To the discerning
eye of Washington, grounds of serious apprehension
existed; but, nevertheless, with his usual calmness and
energy, he adopted every measure within his means to
sustain his position, and inspire his soldiers with hope and
confidence. In his energetic proclamations addressed to
the army, he exhorted them "to animate and encourage
each other, and show the whole world that a freeman, contending
for liberty on his own ground, is superior to any
slavish mercenary on earth."</p>

<p>As Washington was necessarily ignorant by what route
the British would choose to approach the city, he was
reluctantly compelled to divide his forces. A part were
stationed in the city, a part at Brooklyn, Long Island, and
detachments at various other assailable points.</p>

<p>Thus the armies, more numerous than had hitherto been
collected, were fairly arranged, and every succeeding day
was bringing nearer a contest which might decide the fate
of the new republic.</p>

<p>At length, from various indications, the American general
was convinced that the first attack would be upon the
forces at Brooklyn. Accordingly, he rëinforced that point,
by a detachment of six regiments, and placed General
Putnam in command.</p>

<p>"On the 22d of August, the British forces were landed
on the opposite side of Long Island. The two armies
were now about four miles asunder, and were separated
by a range of hills, over which passed three main roads.
Various circumstances led General Putnam to suspect that
the enemy intended to approach him by the road leading to
his right, which he therefore guarded with most care.</p>

<p>"Very early in the morning of the 26th, his suspicions
were strengthened by the approach upon that road, of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
column of British troops, and upon the center road, of a
column of Hessians. To oppose these, the American troops
were mostly drawn from the camp, and in the engagements
which took place, evinced considerable bravery.</p>

<p>"These movements of the enemy were but feints to
divert the attention of Putnam from the road which led to
his left, along which General Clinton was silently advancing
with the main body of the British army. The report of
cannon in that direction, gave the first intimation of the
danger which was approaching. The Americans endeavored
to escape it, by returning with the utmost celerity to
their camp. They were not able to arrive there in time,
but were intercepted by General Clinton, who drove them
back upon the Hessians.</p>

<p>"Attacked thus in front and rear, they fought a succession
of skirmishes, in the course of which many were killed,
many were made prisoners; and several parties, seeing
favorable opportunities, forced their way through the
enemy, and regained the camp. A bold and vigorous
charge, made by the American general, Lord Sterling, at
the head of a Maryland regiment, enabled a large body to
escape in this manner. This regiment, fighting with desperate
bravery, kept a force greatly superior engaged, until
their comrades had passed by, when the few who survived,
ceasing to resist, surrendered to the enemy.</p>

<p>"The loss of the Americans in killed, wounded, and taken
prisoners, considerably exceeded a thousand. Among the
latter, were Generals Sullivan, Sterling, and Woodhull.
The total loss of the enemy was less than four hundred."<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>In the height of the engagement, Washington crossed
over to Brooklyn, and seeing some of his best troops
slaughtered or taken, he uttered, it is said, an exclamation
of anguish. He could, if he saw fit, draw out of their
encampment all the troops, and send them to succor the
corps that were engaged with the enemy; he might also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
call over all the forces he had in New York, and order
them to take part in the battle. But all these rëinforcements
would by no means have sufficed to render his army
equal to that of the English. Victory having already
declared in their favor, the courage with which it inspired
them, and the superiority of their discipline, cut off all hope
of being able to restore the battle. If Washington had
engaged all his troops in the action, it is probable that the
entire army would have been destroyed on this fatal day,
and America reduced to subjection. Great praise, therefore,
is due to him for not having allowed himself, in so
grave circumstances, to be transported into an inconsiderate
resolution, and for having preserved himself and his army
for a happier future.</p>

<p>The English were so elated with victory, that eager to
profit by their advantages, they would fain have immediately
assaulted the American camp. But their general
manifested more prudence; whether he believed the
intrenchments of the enemy stronger than they really
were, or whether he considered himself already sure of
entering New York, without encountering new perils, he
repressed the ardor of his troops. Afterwards, encamping,
in front of the enemy's lines, in the night of the 28th, he
broke ground within six hundred paces of a bastion upon the
left. His intention was to approach by means of trenches,
and to wait till the fleet could cöoperate with the troops.</p>

<p>The situation of the Americans in their camp became
extremely critical. They had, in front, an enemy superior
in number, and who could attack them at any moment
with a new advantage. Their intrenchments were of little
moment, and the English, pushing their works with ardor,
had every possibility of success in their favor.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>Added to these unfavorable circumstances, the arms and
ammunition of the soldiers had suffered from a powerful
and long-continued rain. Besides, they were worn out with
fatigue, and discouraged by defeat. Thus environed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
difficulty and danger, a council of war decided that to
evacuate their position, and retire to New York, was the
part of wisdom and safety.</p>

<p>The accomplishment of this project, however, was a
movement attended with difficulty, but was effected with
great skill and judgment, and with complete success. The
commencement of the retreat was appointed for eight
o'clock on the night of the 29th; but a strong north-east
wind and a rapid tide, caused a delay of several hours.
In this extremity, Heaven remarkably favored the fugitive
army. A south-east wind springing up at eleven, essentially
facilitated its passage from the island to the city; and a
thick fog hanging over Long Island from about two in the
morning, concealed its movements from the enemy, who
were so near, that the sound of their pickaxes and shovels
was heard. In about half an hour after, the fog cleared
away, and the enemy were seen taking possession of the
American lines. General Washington, as far as possible,
inspected every thing. From the commencement of the
action on the morning of the 27th, until the troops were
safely across the East river, he never closed his eyes, and
was almost constantly on horseback. His wisdom and
vigilance, with the interposing favor of Divine Providence,
saved the army from destruction.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>The defeat experienced by the Americans at Brooklyn,
spread a deep gloom through the army; and excited, on that
account, no little anxiety in the bosom of Washington. It
was the first serious loss which they had sustained&mdash;the
first reverse which essentially shook their confidence and
weakened their courage.</p>

<p>To Washington and his officers, the great defect in the
American army was apparent. It was twofold&mdash;first, the
employment of by far too large a proportion of militia, and
secondly, the utter impracticability of introducing among
them that discipline and subordination which could place
them on equal footing with the practised and veteran troops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
of the enemy. At length, convinced of the justness of the
views of Washington on these points, congress decided
that a regular army should be formed, in which the soldiers
should be enlisted to serve during the present war; and
that it should consist of eighty-eight battalions, to be raised
in all the provinces, according to their respective abilities.
A bounty of twenty dollars, and a grant of land, were
offered. At a subsequent date, soldiers were allowed to
enlist for three years; in which case, however, they were
not entitled to the grant of land. Had congress, at an
earlier day, taken this measure to furnish an adequate
army for Washington, both he and the country might have
been saved great anxiety, and a succession of mortifying
defeats. And but for the adoption of the above resolution,
it is scarcely possible to predict what would have been the
ultimate fate of the new republic.</p>

<p>Fortunate would it have been for the Americans, had
their ill-fortune terminated in the defeat experienced on
Long Island. To other and not much less mortifying
reverses they were destined, ere the deepest point of
depression should be reached.</p>

<p>It was the ardent wish of Washington to retain possession
of New York; but, finding, as he said, in a communication
to congress, the militia "dismayed and intractable,"
and "leaving the camp in some instances almost by regiments,
by half-ones, and by companies at a time;" he was
compelled to relinquish the place to his enemies, and to
abandon, which he still more regretted, all the heavy
artillery, and a large portion of the baggage, provisions, and
military stores. On leaving the city, the American army
took post on Harlem heights.</p>

<p>Here Washington had time to ponder upon his situation,
and form his plan. His army had become seriously reduced,
and from the despondency and dismay which were visible
among them, it might become at anytime still more reduced.
On the other hand, the forces of the enemy were numerous,
and withal consisted of regular and well-disciplined troops.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
It was futile, therefore, to attempt to maintain offensive
operations against them. Far better in his judgment to
risk no general engagement; but by retiring gradually
before them, to lead them as far as possible from their
resources; and in the mean while to inspire his own troops
with courage, by engaging them in skirmishes, where
success was probable. Having adopted this cautious system,
he prepared to put it in practice.</p>

<p>The British army did not long entertain its position on
York Island. The British frigates, having passed up the
North river, under a fire from Fort Washington and the post
opposite to it on the Jersey shore, General Howe embarked
a great part of his army in flat-bottomed boats, and passing
through Hurl Gate into the sound, landed at Frog's neck.
The object of the British general was, either to force
Washington out of his present lines, or to inclose him in
them. Aware of this design, General Washington moved
a part of his troops from York island to join those at King's
bridge, and detached some regiments to Westchester. A
council of war was now called, and the system of evacuation
and retreating was adopted, with the exception of
Fort Washington, for the defence of which nearly three
thousand men were assigned. After a halt of six days, the
royal army advanced, not without considerable opposition,
along the coast of Long Island sound, by New Rochelle, to
White Plains, where the Americans took a strong position
behind intrenchments. This post was maintained for several
days, till the British, having received considerable rëinforcements,
General Washington withdrew to the heights
of North Castle, about five miles from White Plains, where,
whether from the strength of his position, or from the
British general having other objects in view, no attempt at
attack was made.</p>

<p>Immediately on leaving White Plains, General Howe
directed his attention to Fort Washington and Fort Lee, as
their possession would secure the navigation of the Hudson,
and facilitate the invasion of New Jersey. On the 15th of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
November, General Howe, being in readiness for the
assault, summoned the garrison to surrender. Colonel
Magaw the commanding officer, in spirited language,
replied, that he should defend his works to extremity. On
the succeeding morning, the British made the assault in
four separate divisions; and, after a brave and obstinate
resistance, surmounted the outworks, and again summoned
the garrison to surrender. His ammunition being
nearly expended, and his force incompetent to repel the
numbers which were ready on every side to assail him,
Colonel Magaw surrendered himself and his garrison, consisting
of two thousand men, prisoners of war. The
enemy lost in the assault nearly eight hundred men, mostly
Germans. The conquest of Fort Washington made the
evacuation of Fort Lee necessary. Orders were, therefore,
issued to remove the ammunition and stores in it;
but, before much progress had been made in this business,
Lord Cornwallis crossed the Hudson, with a number of
battalions, with the intention to inclose the garrison between
the Hackensack and North rivers. This movement made a
precipitate retreat indispensable, which was happily effected
with little loss of men; but the greater part of the artillery,
stores, and baggage, was left for the enemy. The loss at
Fort Washington was heavy. The regiments captured in
it were some of the best troops in the army. The tents,
camp-kettles, and stores, lost at this place and at Fort Lee,
could not, during the campaign, be rëplaced, and for the
want of them the men suffered extremely. This loss was
unnecessarily sustained, as those posts ought, unquestionably,
to have been evacuated before General Howe was in
a situation to invest them; and this event was the more to
be deplored, as the American force was daily diminished by
the expiration of the soldiers' term of enlistment, and by the
desertion of the militia.</p>

<p>These successes encouraged the British to pursue the
remaining American force, with the prospect of annihilating
it. General Washington, who had taken post at Newark,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
on the south side of the Passaic, finding himself unable to
make any real opposition, withdrew from that place, as the
enemy crossed the Passaic, and retreated to Brunswick,
on the Raritan; and Lord Cornwallis, on the same day,
entered Newark. The retreat was still continued from
Brunswick to Princeton; from Princeton to Trenton; and
from Trenton to the Pennsylvania side of the Delaware.
The pursuit was urged with so much rapidity, that the rear
of one army was often within shot of the van of the other.</p>

<p>The winter being now set in, the British army went into
quarters, between the Delaware and the Hackensack.
Trenton, the most important post and barrier, was occupied
by a brigade of Hessians, under Colonel Rawle. General
Howe now issued a proclamation, in the name of his
brother and himself, in which pardon was offered to all persons
who, within the space of sixty days, should take the
oath of allegiance, and submit to the authority of the British
government. The effects of this proclamation were soon
apparent. People from several quarters availed themselves
of it, and threw down their arms. No city or town, indeed,
in its corporate capacity, submitted to the British government,
but most of the families of fortune and influence
discovered an inclination to return to their allegiance.
Many of the yeomanry claimed the benefit of the commissioner's
proclamation; and the great body of them were
too much taken up with the security of their families and
their property to make any exertion in the public cause.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
Another source of mortification to the Americans, was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
capture of General Lee, who had imprudently ventured to
lodge at a house three miles distant from his corps.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>"This was the most gloomy period of the revolutionary
war. It was the crisis of the struggle of the United States
for independence. The American army, reduced in numbers,
depressed by defeat, and exhausted by fatigue, naked,
barefoot, and destitute of tents, and even of utensils with
which to dress their scanty provisions, was fleeing before a
triumphant enemy, well-appointed and abundantly supplied.
A general spirit of despondency through New Jersey was
the consequence of this disastrous state of public affairs.
But, in this worst of times, congress stood unmoved; their
measures exhibited no symptoms of confusion or dismay;
the public danger only roused them to more vigorous exertions,
that they might give a firmer tone to the public mind,
and animate the citizens of the United America to a manly
defence of their independence. Beneath this cloud of
adversity, too, General Washington shone with a brighter
lustre than in the day of his highest prosperity. Not dismayed
by all the difficulties which encompassed him, he
accommodated his measures to his situation, and still made
the good of his country the object of his unwearied pursuit.
He ever wore the countenance of composure and confidence,
and inspired, by his own example, his little band
with firmness to struggle with adverse fortune."<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>Irrespective of the special blessing of Heaven, the
colonies of America entered upon the revolutionary war
with fearful chances against them. That they well knew,
and hence that blessing was more universally sought than
by any other people, in similar circumstances, since the
founding of empires. The cause was remembered by those
who offered the incense of prayer morning and evening on
the family altar. Scarcely a Sabbath occurred, on which
the embassadors of God did not make public mention, in
their addresses to a Throne of grace, of the American
cause; and fervent supplications for Divine aid in supporting
that cause, and, carrying it to a prosperous issue, were to
be heard in every church. Nor were colonial assemblies&mdash;nor,
after its organization, the continental congress&mdash;backward
in recognising the necessity of propitiating the Divine
favor. Not a single instance, it is believed, is on record,
and probably never occurred, in which a legislator in a
provincial assembly attached to the patriotic cause, or a
member of congress, opposed the adoption of any resolution
which had for its object the humiliation of the people in the
season of national adversity, or the rendering of due thanks
to God in the day of prosperity. There were men concerned
in conducting the military operations of the Revolution,
and in guiding the counsels of the nation, who were
far from being personally religious; but such was the pervading
influence of piety in the land, that they would have
manifested no open opposition, had they felt it; nor is it
to be credited, in the absence of positive evidence, that
such feelings ever existed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span></p>

<p>The reverses sustained by the Americans, detailed in the
preceding pages, were most sensibly felt in every portion
of the land. Notwithstanding the knowledge of the superiority
of the British, in regard to numerical force, but much
more in respect to munitions of war, and the disciplined
character of their soldiery, the Americans had cherished
the expectation of success. Their confidence at the commencement
of the struggle had been raised, and strengthened
by the issue of the affairs at Lexington, and Bunker's
hill, and the evacuation of Boston. Success thus early was
positively essential to success in the sequel. Had they
early met with reverses, such as were experienced from
the discomfiture at Brooklyn to the battle of Trenton, it is
doubtful whether that resolution would not have failed, and
with the failure of that, the contest have been relinquished.</p>

<p>Those reverses, though painful and mortifying, were
perhaps even salutary. A firmer reliance upon Providence
was felt to be needful, and a holier tide of supplication
ascended to the Arbiter of the fate of nations.</p>

<p>The connexion between an acknowledgment of God in
his providence, and his blessing on the common cause, was
recognised by no body with more readiness than by the
continental congress. Although in May, 1776, that body
had recommended a public fast, in view of the gloomy
reverses which had attended the American arms, on the
11th of December, in a resolution, which for the tone of its
piety cannot be too much admired, and which might serve
as a model to future ages, they recommended the observance
of a day of fasting and humiliation: "Whereas the war in
which the United States are engaged with Great Britain,
has not only been prolonged, but is likely to be carried to
the greatest extremity; and whereas it becomes all public
bodies, as well as private persons, to reverence the providence
of God, and look up to him as the Supreme Disposer
of all events, and the Arbiter of the fate of nations; therefore
<i>Resolved</i>, that it be recommended to all the United States,
as soon as possible, to appoint a day of solemn fasting and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
humiliation; to implore of Almighty God the forgiveness of
the many sins prevailing among all ranks, and to beg the
countenance and assistance of his providence in the prosecution
of the present just and necessary war. The congress
do also, in the most solemn manner, recommend to all the
members of the United States, and particularly the officers,
civil and military, under them, the exercise of repentance
and reformation; and, further, require of them the strict
observation of the articles of war, and particularly that
part of the said articles which forbids profane swearing
and all immorality, of which all such officers are desired to
take notice."<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>We left Washington on the Pennsylvania side of the
Delaware&mdash;his army greatly reduced by the return of
numbers to their homes, and depressed by a long and disheartening
retreat before an exulting foe. Nor would the
Americans have now been permitted to pause in safety,
had the British commander succeeded in procuring the
means necessary to make the passage of the river. Finding
his efforts for this purpose, however, fruitless, he began
his preparations for retiring into winter-quarters. The
main body of the army was therefore cantoned between
the Delaware and the Hackensack: about four thousand
men occupied positions between Trenton and Mount Holly,
and strong detachments lay at Princeton, Brunswick, and
Elizabethtown. The object of this dispersion over so wide
an extent of country, was to intimidate the people, and thus
prevent the possibility of recruiting for the continental
service; while in the spring these forces could be immediately
concentrated, and it was then proposed to put an
easy conclusion to all rebellious contumacy.</p>

<p>The desperate condition of his country's fortunes now
pressed with saddening weight upon the mind of Washington,
and he resolved, if possible, to retrieve misfortune by
some daring enterprise. To such an enterprise he was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
more inclined, since, with the exception of about fifteen
hundred effectives, his whole force would be entitled in a
few days to its discharge. Having formed his plan&mdash;an
attack upon the British posts on the Delaware&mdash;he proceeded
to put it in execution.</p>

   <img src="images/illus-350.jpg" alt="Battle of Trenton." title="Battle of Trenton."/>
   <p class="caption2">Battle of Trenton.</p>
</div>

<p>Early in the morning of the 26th of December, 1776, the
main body of the American army, twenty-four hundred
strong, and headed by Washington in person, crossed the
river at M'Konkey's ferry, about nine miles above Trenton.
The night was tempestuous with rain and sleet, and the
river encumbered with quantities of floating ice, so that the
passage, although begun soon after midnight, was not fully
effected until three o'clock, and one hour more elapsed
before the march could be commenced. The Americans
moved in two divisions along the roads leading to the town,
and their operations were so well combined, and executed
with such precision, that the two attacks on the British outposts
were made within three minutes of each other. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
pickets attempted resistance, but were almost immediately
driven in upon the main body, which was forming hurriedly
in line. Colonel Rawle, their commander, soon after fell,
mortally wounded; the confusion of the soldiery became
irremediable; and, after a loss of about twenty killed, one
thousand men laid down their arms, and surrendered their
munitions and artillery. On the American side, the loss in
battle amounted to only two killed and four wounded;
among the latter, James Monroe, afterwards president of
the United States.</p>

<p>The other parts of this brilliant enterprise were not,
however, executed with the same success. General Irvine
had been instructed to cross at Trenton ferry, and, by
securing a bridge below the town, to cut off the enemy's
march along the Bordentown road. Notwithstanding all
his exertions, it was found that the ice had rendered the
passage impracticable; and five hundred fugitives from the
disastrous field of Trenton were thus enabled to escape by
a speedy and well-timed retreat. General Cadwallader
was to have crossed at Drink's ferry, and carried the post
at Mount Holly; but the same impediment prevented this
movement also, and he was compelled to return with a part
of his infantry which had effected the passage. Deprived
of this important and expected cöoperation, Washington
had, nevertheless, achieved a most critical and important
triumph; he returned to his former position, charged with
the spoils and trophies of his foes; and from that moment,
though reverses frequently dimmed the brilliancy of the
prospect, hope never again deserted the cause of American
independence.</p>

<p>Having secured the Hessian prisoners on the Pennsylvania
side of the Delaware, Washington rëcrossed the river
two days after the action, and took possession of Trenton.
Generals Mifflin and Cadwallader, who lay at Bordentown
and Crosswix with three thousand six hundred militia, were
ordered to march up in the night of the 1st of January, to
join the commander-in-chief, whose whole effective force,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
including this accession, did not exceed five thousand men.
The detachments of the British army, which had been distributed
over New Jersey, now assembled at Princeton, and
were joined by the army from Brunswick, under Lord Cornwallis.
From this position, the enemy advanced towards
Trenton in great force, on the morning of the 2d of January;
and, after some slight skirmishing with troops detached to
harass and delay their march, the van of their army reached
Trenton about four in the afternoon. On their approach,
General Washington retired across the Assumpinck, a rivulet
that runs through the town; and by some field-pieces,
posted on its opposite banks, compelled them, after attempting
to cross in several places, to fall back out of the reach
of his guns. The two armies, kindling their fires, retained
their positions on opposite sides of the rivulet, and kept up
a cannonade till night.</p>

<p>The situation of the American general at this moment
was extremely critical. Nothing but a stream, fordable in
many places, separated his army from an enemy, in every
respect his superior. If he remained in his present position,
he was certain of being attacked the next morning, at the
hazard of the entire destruction of his little army. If he
should retreat over the Delaware, the ice in that river not
being firm enough to admit a passage upon it, there was
danger of great loss&mdash;perhaps of a total defeat: the Jerseys
would be in full possession of the enemy; the public mind
would be depressed; recruiting would be discouraged; and
Philadelphia would be within the reach of General Howe.
In this extremity, he boldly determined to abandon the
Delaware; and, by a circuitous march along the left flank
of the enemy, fall into their rear at Princeton, which was
known to be occupied by three British regiments.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>About sunrise, at a short distance from the town, they
encountered two of these regiments, marching forward in
order to cöoperate in the expected battle, and a warm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
engagement immediately commenced. The American general
was well aware that the existence of his country hung
suspended in the scale of victory; and he exerted himself
as one who knew the importance of the object, and felt that
success depended on his efforts. Wherever the fire was
hottest, or the press of battle most fearful, Washington was
sure to be found, guiding the thunders of war, and animating
all by his language and example. At length, the British
line was broken, and the two regiments separated. Colonel
Mawhood, with the division in the van, pushed rapidly forward
for the main army; while the fifty-fifth, cut off from
this point of support, fled in confusion across the fields to
Brunswick. The Americans now pressed the remaining
regiment, which at first attempted a defence in the college;
but this was soon abandoned, and those who were not captured,
escaped only by precipitate flight. The British loss
amounted to one hundred killed and three hundred prisoners;
the conquerors had to lament the death of General
Mercer, an experienced officer, much respected by the
commander-in-chief.</p>

<p>"The battles of Trenton and Princeton, though similar
in their outlines, were very different in point of conception
and execution. The attack upon Trenton was a blow
struck against an enemy in position, which admitted, therefore,
of every advantage of preparation on the part of the
assailants. The battle of Princeton belonged to a higher
and more elaborate order of tactics. The American forces
were already engaged with a superior army, commanded
by an officer of eminent reputation; and the change of
plan was wholly contrived and executed with the enemy
in front. It was entirely due to the prompt genius, and
fertile resources of Washington, that his army was extricated
from so perilous an exposure, and enabled to attack
the enemy's rear with such advantage, as to leave it no
choice but surrender or flight. A military critic, contemplating
these inspirations with a soldier's eye, can easily
appreciate the feelings of the great Frederick, when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
sent a sword to the American commander, 'as a gift from
the world's oldest general to its <i>best</i>.'"</p>

<p>As a natural result of these unexpected man&#339;uvres, the
British officers were thrown into a state of uncertainty,
which gave to their subsequent operations an unusual character
of timidity. The distant roll of the American artillery
at Princeton, first announced to Lord Cornwallis the danger
of his rear, and the escape of his active adversary. Alarmed
for the safety of his magazines, the British commander
instantly broke up from the Assumpinck, and commenced
a forced march upon New Brunswick; moving with such
celerity as nearly to overtake the American rear at Princeton.
On the other hand, Sir William Howe drew in all his
forces, by concentration in the neighborhood of Amboy
and Brunswick, and abandoned all hope of preventing the
recruiting service by overawing the whole extent of the
country. Washington, finding the surprise of the stores
impossible, moved northward into the highlands of Jersey,
in order to afford some relief to the fatigues of his troops;
for long and severe exposure to the inclemencies of the
winter, without the usual protections, had produced sickness,
and even complaint. It was finally considered necessary
to abandon offensive operations, and to put the army
under cover at Morristown. Among other prudent precautions
adopted, during this temporary respite, the commander-in-chief
caused the whole army to be innoculated;
an operation then very uncommon in America, but which
enabled him thereafter to defy a disease, which had proved
more fatal than the sword of the enemy.</p>

<p>The situation of American affairs&mdash;though far from
brilliant&mdash;was much improved by the late successes. The
people of Jersey rose with fresh spirit, and in a number of
small skirmishes inflicted loss upon the enemy, both in men
and stores: new hope was made to animate the public
mind; while congress fanned the flame by judicious and
well-timed incitements to vigorous action. Washington
was authorized to raise sixteen regiments, and in further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
testimony of the public confidence, he was invested for six
months with almost dictatorial powers in the conduct of
the war. It was, however, found to be impossible to collect
a sufficient force for active operations upon any considerable
scale during the winter. All the hopes of the commander-in-chief
were therefore turned to the next campaign; and
in the mean time an active warfare was carried on with
small posts and foraging parties, which greatly annoyed
the British army; while the frequent reports of fresh successes
excited the spirit of the American people. The
most earnest applications were made to the several states,
for rëinforcements enlisted upon longer terms; for, as Washington
strongly observed, "to the short engagements of our
troops may be fairly and justly ascribed almost every misfortune
that we have experienced." These representations
produced at last their due impression; and the hope was
abandoned of defending the country by hasty assemblages
of militia, and of carrying on a protracted warfare upon the
impulse and mere foundation of disinterested patriotism.</p>

<p>During the winter of 1776-7, the American army
encamped, as already noticed, at Morristown. The royal
army occupied Brunswick. Towards the close of May,
the former, which had been augmented by recruits to
almost ten thousand men, removed from Morristown to a
fortified position at Middlebrook. The British soon after
left their encampment, General Howe endeavoring, by
various movements, to induce Washington to quit his stronghold
and meet him on equal ground. But the latter, too
prudent and sagacious to risk an engagement with a force
so decidedly superior, determined to remain in his present
secure position, until the designs of the British were more
fully developed.</p>

<p>At length, the British commander, wearied with an unprofitable
contest with an enemy which had the decided advantage
as to position, and satisfied that his adversary would,
on no consideration, hazard a general engagement, resolved
to abandon New Jersey, and direct his attention to the
occupation of Philadelphia.</p>

<p>In pursuance of this plan, the British forces fell back
upon Amboy, and soon after passed over to Staten Island.
Leaving Sir Henry Clinton in command at New York,
General Howe, on the 26th of July, put out to sea with
sixteen thousand troops. His destination was carefully
concealed. Unfavorable winds delayed his voyage beyond
his wishes; but, on the 20th of August, he entered Chesapeake
bay, and thus rendered it certain that an attack
upon Philadelphia was intended. On the 25th, the troops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
were landed at Elk ferry, in Maryland, fifty miles south
of the city.</p>

<p>Washington, penetrating the designs of his adversary,
and yielding to the wishes of a great portion of the people
in that section of the country, that a general engagement
should be hazarded for the defence of Philadelphia, moved
with his army across the Delaware, and hastening his
march, passed through and took a position on the eastern
bank of Brandywine creek, with the hope of giving a
check to the advancing foe. The force of Washington,
including irregulars, was now about eleven thousand men.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the British army was advancing towards
Philadelphia. "At day-break, on the morning of the 11th,
(Washington having crossed the Brandywine, and taken
position on a height behind that river,) it was ascertained,
that Sir William Howe in person had crossed the Brandywine
at the forks, and was rapidly marching down the north
side of the river to attack the American army. The commander-in-chief
now ordered General Sullivan to form the
right wing to oppose the column of Sir William. General
Wayne was directed to remain at Chadd's ford with the
left wing, to dispute the passage of the river with Knyphausen.
General Green, with his division, was posted as a
reserve in the center, between Sullivan and Wayne, to
rëinforce either, as circumstances might require. General
Sullivan marched up the river, until he found favorable
ground on which to form his men; his left was near the
Brandywine, and both flanks were covered with thick
wood. At half-past four o'clock, when his line was
scarcely formed, the British, under Lord Cornwallis, commenced
a spirited attack. The action was for some time
severe; but the American right, which was not properly in
order when the assault began, at length gave way, and
exposed the flank of the troops, that maintained their
ground, to a destructive fire, and, continuing to break from
the right, the whole line finally gave way. As soon as the
firing began, General Washington, with General Greene's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
division, hastened towards the scene of action, but, before
his arrival, Sullivan was routed, and the commander-in-chief
could only check the pursuit of the enemy, and cover
the retreat of the beaten troops. During these transactions,
General Knyphausen assaulted the works erected
for the defence of Chadd's ford, and soon carried them.
General Wayne, by this time learning the fate of the
other divisions, drew off his troops. General Washington
retreated with his whole force that night to Chester. The
American loss in this battle was about three hundred killed
and six hundred wounded. Four hundred were made
prisoners, but these chiefly of the wounded." Among the
latter were two general officers; the Marquis de la Fayette
and General Woodford. Count Pulaski, a Polish nobleman,
fought also with the Americans in this battle.</p>

   <p class="caption2">General Wayne.</p>
</div>

<p>"Perceiving that the enemy were moving into the Lancaster
road towards the city, General Washington took
possession of ground near the Warren tavern, on the left
of the British, and twenty-three miles from Philadelphia.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
The protection of his stores at Reading was one object of
this movement. The next morning, he was informed of the
approach of the British army. He immediately put his
troops in motion to engage the enemy. The advance of
the two hostile armies met, and began to skirmish, when a
violent storm came on, which prevented a general engagement,
and rendered the retreat of the Americans absolutely
necessary. The inferiority of the muskets in the hands of
the American soldiery, which had been verified in every
action, was strikingly illustrated in this retreat. The gun-locks
being badly made, and the cartridge-boxes imperfectly
constructed, this storm rendered most of the arms unfit for
use, and all the ammunition was damaged. The army
was, in consequence, extremely exposed, and their danger
became the greater, as many of the soldiers were destitute
of bayonets. Fortunately the tempest, which produced
such serious mischief to the Americans, prevented the pursuit
of the British. Washington still continued to make
every effort to save the capitol; but Sir William Howe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
having secured the command of the Schuylkill, on the 23d
of September, crossed it with his whole army; on the 26th,
he advanced to Germantown, and, on the succeeding day,
Lord Cornwallis, at the head of a strong detachment,
entered Philadelphia in triumph." Congress removed from
the city, and immediately rëassembled at Lancaster. Fortunately,
through the precautions of Washington, the military
stores and deposits at Philadelphia, had been removed
up the Delaware, and were thus prevented from falling into
the hands of the enemy.</p>

   <p class="caption2">Marquis de la Fayette.</p>
</div>

<p>Passing over some unimportant events, we arrive at the
4th of October, on the morning of which day, the American
army made a spirited attack upon a strong body of
British forces encamped at Germantown, a village of a
single street, beginning about five miles from Philadelphia,
and extending along the road about two miles more. Lord
Cornwallis occupied the city with another division, and a
numerous detachment had marched to Chester, as an escort
for a convoy of provisions. A fair opportunity for assailing
the enemy in detail was thus offered to the enterprise of the
American commander, and he was not slow in perceiving
its advantages. He accordingly chose, for his point of
assault, the advanced camp at Germantown, and made
masterly arrangements for surrounding and destroying that
exposed division of the enemy, before rëinforcements could
arrive from Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Never was an attack more auspiciously begun, or the
prospect of a decisive victory, for a time, more flattering.
But the British army, at length, recovering from its first
surprise, rallied the fugitives, and prepared vigorously to
assume the offensive. The fortunes of the day, in consequence,
changed, and Washington became convinced of the
necessity of withdrawing his troops from the contest. The
disputed town was therefore evacuated by the Americans.
According to the official returns of the English general,
his loss in the battle of Germantown scarcely exceeded
five hundred men. On the side of the Americans, two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
hundred were killed, more than five hundred wounded,
and four hundred made prisoners. Congress passed a
resolution highly commending the plan of the battle, and
thanking the commander and the army for their courage
and conduct.</p>

<p>The main object of the American commander was now
to compel the evacuation of Philadelphia, by cutting off the
supplies of the British army. The fleet was effectually
prevented from cöoperation by the obstructions fixed in the
channel of the Delaware, and by two small forts&mdash;one
called Fort Mifflin, on Mud Island, near the confluence of
the Delaware and Schuylkill, and the other at Red Bank,
on the opposite Jersey shore. Strong parties of militia
scoured the whole country in the neighborhood of the city,
for the purpose of enforcing the resolution of congress,
which subjected to martial law all persons supplying provisions
to the enemy.</p>

<p>Sir William Howe soon felt the increasing difficulties of
his situation, and began to prepare his plans for their forcible
removal. Works were erected against Fort Mifflin,
which produced severe conflicts with Colonel Samuel
Smith, who commanded the station. Lord Howe came
up the river, with his ships of war and transports, and
anchored from New Castle to Reedy Island; some frigates
being detached, in advance, to remove the <i>chevaux de frise</i>
that encumbered the channel. Considerable difficulties
were encountered in effecting this object, so that the
obstructions below Mud Island were not cleared until the
middle of October, while those, covered by the American
guns, were yet untouched. The capture of the forts
was, therefore, the next object, and it was accordingly
attempted by a combined attack on land and water.</p>

<p>The importance to the British of effecting the reduction
of these forts, brought into requisition every possible
means. On the other hand, the most determined resistance
was made for their defence; but, at length, the Americans
were obliged to yield them up to superior force;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
in consequence of which, Sir William Howe was fully
secured in his conquest of Philadelphia, and in the possession
of an uninterrupted communication between his
army and fleet.</p>

<p>The occupation of Philadelphia by the British, was
to them an important movement. Washington deeply
regretted the success of the enterprise by which it fell into
their hands; but he had no occasion to reproach himself in
view of the event. He had taken every precaution, and
made every effort to prevent the loss of so important a
place. But the benefits anticipated by the British, were
scarcely realized. The prospects of the Americans were,
after all, growing brighter, and events were hastening on,
which were to make those prospects brighter still.</p>

<p>Events of deep interest transpiring in the north, must
divert our attention for a time, from the military operations
of the middle states.</p>

<p>At an earlier day, a scheme had been formed by the
British ministers, of opening a way to New York, by
means of their army, which should descend from the lakes
to the banks of the Hudson, and unite in the vicinity of
Albany with the whole, or a part of that commanded by
General Howe, from the south. By means of such a
man&#339;uvre, the eastern and western provinces would be
separated from each other; and thus, being prevented from
furnishing mutual succor, would become an easy prey to
the royal forces.</p>

<p>Obstacles had prevented the execution of this plan in the
latter part of 1776, as originally intended, but now (the
early part of 1777) it was designed to be prosecuted with
a vigor and resolution corresponding to its importance.</p>

<p>To General Burgoyne, an officer distinguished for his
ability, and possessed of a competent knowledge of the
country, and, moreover, animated with an ardent thirst for
military glory, the expedition from the north was confided;
while General Howe was expected to lead up the royal
forces from the south.</p>

<p>General Burgoyne arrived at Quebec in the beginning
of May; and being seconded by General Carleton, immediately
prepared himself to push forward the business of
his mission. The regular force of General Burgoyne consisted
of upwards of seven thousand British and German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
troops, exclusive of a corps of artillery of five hundred.
Seven hundred rangers, under Colonel St. Leger, were
added, designed to make an incursion into the country of
the Mohawks, and to seize Fort Stanwix, otherwise called
Fort Schuyler. It was expected, also, that two thousand
Canadians, including hatchmen and other workmen, would
join the army. And, finally, one thousand Indians were
induced to unite in the expedition. A train of artillery seldom
equalled, either in numbers, or in the skill of those who
managed it, also accompanied the army. Able and experienced
officers had been selected to direct its movements.
The principal were, Major-general Philips, of the artillery,
who had distinguished himself in the wars of Germany;
the Brigadier-generals Frazer, Powel, and Hamilton, with
the Brunswick Major-general Baron Reidesel, and Brigadier-general
Specht. The whole army shared in the ardor
and hopes of its chiefs; not a doubt was entertained of an
approaching triumph, and the conquest of America.</p>

<p>Thus prepared, General Burgoyne proceeded to encamp
near the little river Bouquet, upon the west bank of Lake
Champlain, at no great distance to the north of Crown
Point. Here having addressed his army in a speech calculated
to excite their highest ardor, and issued a proclamation
warning the Americans against any attempt to resist his
progress, upon pain of savage fury, devastation, famine,
and kindred calamities&mdash;he moved upon Crown Point,
whence soon after he proceeded with all his force to invest
Ticonderoga.</p>

<p>This fortress at the time was under command of General
St. Clair. Believing his garrison, only three thousand men,
one-third of which were militia, inadequate to resist the
attack of so formidable a force as was making its approach,
he ordered its evacuation and the retreat of his army,
having first burned or destroyed every thing which might
prove important to the invading foe.</p>

<p>The night of the 5th of July was appointed for the evacuation.
The British army was near, and peculiar caution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
was to be observed, in order to effect their retreat in safety.
General St. Clair led the van-guard, and Colonel Francis
the rear. The soldiers had received orders to proceed
with silence. St. Clair drew out the van-guard at two in
the morning; Francis with the rear left at four. The baggage,
furniture, military stores, and provisions, had been
embarked on board of two hundred batteaux, and five
armed gallies. The general rendezvous was appointed at
Skenesborough; the batteaux proceeding up Wood creek,
and the main army taking its route by way of Castleton.</p>

<p>Under the animating prospect of affecting their retreat
in safety, the army and batteaux were proceeding on their
respective routes, when suddenly flames burst forth from a
house which had taken fire on Mount Independence, and
discovered by their glare, to the surprise of the royalists,
the retreating patriots.</p>

<p>Immediate orders were issued to the English to pursue.
General Frazer, at the head of a strong detachment of
grenadiers and light troops, proceeded by land along the
right bank of Wood creek. General Reidesel rapidly
followed with his Germans, to aid him if required. General
Burgoyne embarked on board of several vessels, and
gave chase by water.</p>

<p>"By three in the afternoon, the van of the British squadron,
composed of gun-boats, came up with, and attacked
the American gallies, near Skenesborough falls. In the
mean time, three regiments which had been landed at South
bay, ascended and passed a mountain with great expedition,
in order to turn the enemy above Wood creek, to destroy
his works at the falls of Skenesborough, and thus to cut off
his retreat to Fort Anne. But the Americans eluded this
stroke by the rapidity of their flight. The British frigates
having joined the van, the gallies, already hard pressed by
the gun-boats, were completely overpowered. Two of
them surrendered, three were blown up. The Americans
now despaired; having set fire to their works, mills, and
batteaux, and otherwise destroyed what they were unable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
to burn, they escaped as well as they could up Wood
creek, without halting till they reached Fort Anne. Their
loss was considerable; for the batteaux they burned were
loaded with baggage, provisions, and munitions, as necessary
to their sustenance as to military operations. The
corps which had set out by land was in no better situation.
The van-guard, conducted by St. Clair, had arrived
at Castleton, thirty miles distant from Ticonderoga, and
twelve from Skenesborough; the rear, commanded by
Colonels Francis and Warner, had rested the night of the
6th, at Hubbardston, six miles below Castleton, towards
Ticonderoga.</p>

   <p class="caption2">Destruction of Gallies.</p>
</div>

<p>"At five o'clock in the morning of the 7th, the English
column, under General Frazer, made its appearance. The
Americans were strongly posted, and appeared disposed to
defend themselves. Frazer, though inferior in point of
numbers, had great confidence in the valor of his troops.
He also expected every moment to be joined by General
Reidesel; and being apprehensive that the enemy might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
escape if he delayed, he ordered the attack immediately.
The battle was long and sanguinary. The Americans,
being commanded by valiant officers, behaved with great
spirit and firmness; but the English displayed an equal
obstinacy. After several shocks, with alternate success,
the latter began to fall back in disorder; but their leaders
rallied them anew, and led them to a furious charge with
the bayonet; the Americans were shaken by its impetuosity.
At this critical moment, General Reidesel arrived
at the head of his column, composed of light troops and
some grenadiers. He immediately took part in the action.
The Americans, overpowered by numbers, fled on all sides,
leaving their brave commander, with many other officers,
and upwards of two hundred soldiers, dead on the field.
About the same number, besides Colonel Hale, and seventeen
officers of inferior rank, were made prisoners. Above
six hundred were supposed to be wounded; many of whom,
deprived of all succor, perished miserably in the woods.
The loss of the royal troops, in dead and wounded, amounted
to about one hundred and eighty."<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>Upon receiving intelligence of the foregoing disasters,
St. Clair proceeded by a circuitous route to Fort Edward,
in order to strengthen General Schuyler, in anticipation of
an attack upon that fortress. With the accessions thus
made, the troops at Fort Edward amounted to but little
more than four thousand, including the militia. The losses
of the Americans had been great, and were severely felt.
No less than one hundred and twenty-eight pieces of artillery,
besides a great quantity of warlike stores&mdash;baggage,
provisions, particularly flour&mdash;had either fallen into the
hands of the enemy, or had been destroyed. Added to
these losses, a general panic had seized upon the inhabitants,
especially on account of the Indians attached to the
British army, and against whose merciless and savage
spirit there was felt to be no security.</p>

<p>While General Burgoyne was detained at Skenesborough,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
General Schuyler was actively engaged in increasing his
means of defence. Trenches were opened, and the roads
leading to the fort were in every possible way obstructed.
The militia from various quarters were summoned to the
American standard, and artillery and warlike stores were
forwarded from various points.</p>

<p>At length, General Burgoyne moved towards Fort Edward;
but such were the obstacles which impeded his
movements, that he did not reach the banks of the Hudson,
near Fort Edward, till the 30th of July.</p>

<p>In the mean while, under a conviction that, after all the
efforts made to render that fort defensible, it could not be
maintained against so formidable a force as was approaching,
General Schuyler abandoned it, and returned lower
down to Stillwater, where intrenchments were thrown up.</p>

<p>Unexpectedly, General Burgoyne now found himself
nearly destitute of provisions, and from the 30th of July
to the 15th of August, the time was spent in procuring the
means of supporting the army, which were obliged to be
brought from Ticonderoga, at the expense of vast toil and
labor. This, it was afterwards alleged, was the great
mistake of General Burgoyne, that he suffered himself,
after the occupation of Skenesborough, and the discomfiture
of the enemy's army, to have attempted the reduction
of Fort Edward. Had he then made his way directly to
Albany, he might have secured the possession of that
important place to himself, before the Americans could
have rallied.</p>

<p>While thus posted at Fort Edward, General Burgoyne
received intelligence that large stores of live cattle, corn,
and other necessaries belonging to the Americans, had been
deposited at Bennington, a village situated about twenty
miles from the Hudson, in Vermont. Impelled by necessity,
as well as desirous of adding to his military fame, he resolved
to attempt their seizure, the accomplishment of which plan,
he entrusted to Colonel Baum, a German officer of great
bravery, and well versed in this sort of partisan war.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span></p>

<p>Accordingly, with a force of five hundred men and two
light field-pieces, Baum set forth, in proud anticipation of
success. The roads, however, were so heavy, that the
detachment was fatally retarded. The intelligence of their
approach preceded them in time to allow Colonel Stark&mdash;a
brave, active man, who was in command at Bennington, with
a corps of New Hampshire militia&mdash;to assemble a considerable
rëinforcement of Green-mountain Boys from the neighboring
towns. Before Baum made his appearance, the
number of Americans had swelled to about two thousand.
On learning the numbers of the enemy, Baum dispatched
an express to Colonel Breyman, who had been detached to
support him if necessary, to urge his march. In the mean
while, Baum took post on the banks of the Walloon creek,
to await the arrival of his auxiliaries.</p>

<p>Stark, however, was not disposed to accommodate his foe
by any such delay; but, taking up his line of march, on the
morning of the 6th of August, advanced towards the place
of Baum's encampment. Dividing his forces into several
corps, he gave orders to attack the British on all sides at
once. On their approach, Baum strangely mistaking them
for loyalists coming to his aid, held still. Judge his surprise
when they poured in from all sides a deadly fire upon him!
Rallying his men in the best possible manner, for a time he
made a brave resistance; but before the impetuous charge
of the Americans, the English were obliged to yield.</p>

<p>The fortune of the day had already been decided, when
Colonel Breyman appeared. He was, in fact, perfectly
ignorant of the engagement, and the fate of his pioneers.
What was his consternation, on reaching the intrenchments
of Baum, to find, instead of friends ready to receive him,
the place in possession of an enemy ready to give him battle!
Perceiving his mistake, his troops, though greatly fatigued,
were ordered to the combat; and bravely for a time they
fought, and not without some prospect of success, a part
of the Americans being employed in pillaging. But the
momentary advantage which he seemed to have gained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
was soon lost; and, leaving all their baggage and one thousand
muskets in the hands of the conquerors, they made a
rapid retreat. The loss of the British in the two engagements,
was about two hundred killed, and five hundred
wounded and prisoners. The loss of the Americans did
not much exceed one hundred.</p>

<p>The exploit of Bennington redounded not only to the
credit of General Stark and his brave troops, but to the
good of the country at large. It roused the drooping
spirits of the Americans, it inspired the troops with confidence,
and presented an earnest of still nobler conquests.
In consequence of this defeat, the situation of General Burgoyne
was still more perplexing. The hope of supplying
his army with provisions from the stores of Bennington,
was annihilated, and to other quarters he must look for
supplies, without a considerable stock of which, it would be
presumption to attempt offensive operations.</p>

<p>While these events were transpiring, congress appointed
General Gates to take command of the Northern army, in
place of General Schuyler. The latter was a soldier of
great bravery, but was not universally acceptable to the
troops, especially to those from Massachusetts and other
provinces of New England. The former enjoyed a high
military reputation, and his appointment was hailed by the
army with joy. Gates made his appearance at Stillwater
on the 21st of August, and took the command.</p>

<p>"Meanwhile," says Botta, "General Burgoyne continued
in his camp, on the left bank of the Hudson, where he used
the most unremitting industry and perseverance in bringing
stores and provisions forward from Fort George. Having
at length, by strenuous efforts, obtained about thirty days'
provisions, he took a resolution of passing the river with
his army, in order to engage the enemy, and force a passage
to Albany. As a swell of water, occasioned by great rains,
had carried away his bridge of rafts, he threw another, of
boats, over the river at the same place. Towards the middle
of September, he crossed with his army to the right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
bank of the Hudson, and encamped on the heights and in
the plain of Saratoga, Gates being then in the neighborhood
of Stillwater, about three miles below. The two
armies of course faced each other, and a battle was
expected soon to follow."</p>

<p>On the morning of the 19th, it was reported by Colonel
Colburn, who was watching the enemy, that they were
beginning to ascend the hill towards the American left.
General Gates sent Colonel Morgan to oppose them, and
the firing began about noon. The action extended, and, in
three hours, was general, and continued without interruption
till dark. The American troops engaged amounted to
three thousand; the British to three thousand five hundred.</p>

<p>"For four hours," says General Wilkinson, "the battle
fluctuated, like the waves of a stormy sea, with alternate
advantage, without one moment's intermission. It was
truly a gallant conflict, in which death, by its familiarity,
lost its terrors, and certainly a drawn battle, as night alone
terminated it." The British army kept possession of the
field; but they had nothing of which to boast. Their loss
was more than five hundred men, and, among others, Captain
Jones, of the artillery, an officer of great merit; the
loss of the Americans, in killed and wounded, was from
three to four hundred; among the former, were Colonels
Adams and Colburn.</p>

<p>From September 19th to October 7th, was devoted, by
the English, to strengthening their fortifications. The
army of Gates, in the mean while, was continually increasing,
and, on a single occasion, was added to by the arrival
of General Lincoln with two thousand men, well trained
and disciplined, from the New England provinces. Attacks
on the British pickets took place almost every night.</p>

<p>For some time, General Burgoyne had been daily and
ardently waiting for news from General Howe, as to the
cöoperation he intended. On the 20th of September, he
received a letter from that general, informing him that,
about the 20th of the month, he should attempt the reduction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
of Fort Montgomery, situated on the right bank of the
Hudson, and near the Highlands.</p>

<p>The situation of Burgoyne was now becoming so critical,
that he immediately despatched an express to General
Howe, entreating him to hasten his attack on the fort, if
there was any prospect of delay, as he was provided with
necessaries for his army only to the 12th of October, at
which time he would be obliged to move from his present
position.</p>

<p>Near the 1st of October, General Burgoyne found it
necessary to lessen the rations of his soldiers&mdash;a measure
to which they cheerfully submitted. The 7th arrived, and
no further tidings had reached him of the movements of
General Howe.</p>

<p>In this situation, General Burgoyne resolved, as the last
resort, to make a bold and, if possible, a decisive attack.</p>

<p>The battle occurred on the 7th, and a most severe and
sanguinary contest it proved; we have space only for the
results. The loss of the British, in killed, wounded, and
prisoners, was about six hundred; that of the Americans,
three hundred and nineteen. Of the British, Brigadier-general
Frazer, a gallant officer, was mortally wounded,
and Colonel Breyman killed. General Arnold, of the
Americans, was badly wounded, in the same leg which had
already been shattered under the walls of Quebec.</p>

<p>Many pieces of artillery, all the baggage of the Germans,
and many warlike stores, fell into the hands of the
republicans, who needed them greatly. They were impatient
for the return of day, to renew the battle. But
deplorable and perilous, beyond expression, was the situation
of the British troops; they bore it, however, with
admirable temper and firmness. It was evidently impossible
to continue in their present position, without submitting
to a certainty of destruction on the ensuing day.
The Americans, invigorated and encouraged, would take
advantage of the access they had already opened to themselves
on the right, and of other untenable points, to carry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
every part of the camp, and completely surround the
British army. Burgoyne, therefore, determined to operate
a total change of ground. He executed this movement
with admirable order, and without any loss. The artillery,
the camp, and its appurtenances, were all removed, before
morning, to the heights above the hospital. The British
army, in this position, had the river in its rear, and its two
wings displayed along the hills, upon the right bank. The
English expected to be attacked the following day. But
Gates would not expose to the risk of another battle, that
victory of which he was already certain. He intended
that time, famine, and necessity, should complete the work
which his arms had so fortunately commenced. There
were frequent skirmishes, however, occurring in the course
of the day, but of little importance. Towards night, the
obsequies of General Frazer were celebrated in the British
camp; a ceremony mournful of itself, and rendered even terrible
by the sense of recent losses, of future dangers, and of
regret for the deceased. The darkness and silence of the
night aided the effect of the blaze and roar of the American
artillery; while, at every moment, the balls spattered
the earth upon the face of the officiating chaplain.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

   <p class="caption2">BURGOYNE'S RETREAT.</p>
</div>

<p>The situation of General Burgoyne, after the battle, was
gloomy and critical in the extreme. The fortunes of war
were obviously against him, and no safe alternative presented
itself but in retreat. Orders were accordingly
issued for the army to return to Saratoga, six miles up the
river. "The retreat began at nine o'clock; but such was
the badness of the roads, rendered still more difficult by a
heavy rain, which fell that night, and such was the weakness
of the teams, for want of forage, that the English did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a><br /><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
not reach Saratoga till the evening of the ensuing day; the
soldiers were harassed with fatigue and hunger. The hospital,
with three hundred sick and wounded, and a great
number of wheel-carriages, were abandoned to the enemy.
The English, as they retired, burned the houses, and
destroyed whatever they could use no longer."</p>

<p>From the moment that General Gates learned the movements
of the enemy, his plan was formed&mdash;to follow up his
success by a vigorous pursuit, pushing the contest until they
should surrender their arms as a conquered foe.</p>

<p>Accordingly, putting his army in motion, as early as was
practicable, he followed. The only hope which now
inspired Burgoyne was, that he might effect a passage to
Fort Edward, and in that fastness sustain himself till succor
could arrive from the south. But when the intelligence
arrived, as it did at the moment of his deepest perplexity,
that that fortress was in possession of the Americans, he
saw he must relinquish all hope of saving himself by his
own efforts.</p>

<p>The condition of the British army was indeed deplorable.
"The troops, worn down by a series of hard toil, incessant
effort, and stubborn action, abandoned by Indians and
Canadians, the whole army reduced by repeated and heavy
losses of many of their best men and most distinguished
officers, from ten thousand combatants to less than five
thousand fighting men, of whom little more than three
thousand were English. In these circumstances, and in
this state of weakness, without a possibility of retreat, they
were invested by an army of four times their own number,
whose position extended three parts in four of a circle
round them&mdash;who refused to fight from a knowledge of
their own condition&mdash;and who, from the nature of the
ground, could not be attacked in any part. In this helpless
situation, obliged to be constantly on their arms, while a
continued cannonade pervaded all the camp, and even
rifle and grape-shot fell in every part of their lines, the
troops of Burgoyne retained their ordinary constancy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
and, while sinking under a hard necessity, they showed
themselves worthy of a better fate. Nor could they be
reproached with any action or word, which betrayed a
want of temper or fortitude.</p>

<p>"At length, no succor appearing, and no rational ground
of hope of any kind remaining, an exact account of the
provisions was taken on the morning of the thirteenth,
when it was found that the whole stock would afford no
more than three days' bare subsistence for the army. In
such a state, it was alike impossible to advance or to
remain as they were; and the longer they delayed to take
a definite resolution, the more desperate became their situation.
Burgoyne, therefore, immediately called a council
of war, at which not only the generals and field-officers,
but all the captains of companies were invited to assist.
While they deliberated, the bullets of the Americans
whistled around them, and frequently pierced even the
tent, where the council was convened. It was determined,
unanimously, to open a treaty, and enter into a convention
with the American general."</p>

<p>On the night of the 15th, the articles of capitulation were
settled. The morning of the 17th was appointed as the
time on which they were to be signed.</p>

<p>That night (15th) intelligence, by a special messenger,
reached the English camp, that General Clinton had reduced
Fort Montgomery, and was then rapidly marching to their
relief. This added to the suffering of the conquered Burgoyne.
Forthwith, he summoned a council of war, and to
his discredit&mdash;the only apology for which is to be found in
the deep mortification felt by a proud and ambitious soldier
to surrender&mdash;proposed to retreat, and once more try the
fortunes of combat, in the hope that Clinton might arrive
in season to their relief. But his officers, with stricter
notions of propriety, were of the opinion that, as their faith
had been pledged, the honor of the English character
required a fulfillment of the articles of capitulation.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Gates, apprised of the nature of the intelligence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
received, calmly waited for the arrival of the 17th,
on the morning of which he proceeded to form his troops
in the order of battle; which done, he dispatched a messenger
to General Burgoyne, to inform him that the appointed
hour had arrived, and he must either sign the articles, or
prepare himself for battle.</p>

<p>Deeply as the latter regretted submission, he was fully
sensible that circumstances demanded it, and therefore
proceeded to sign the articles, which, in substance, were as
follows:</p>

<p>"That the army should march out of the camp with all
the honors of war and its camp artillery, to a fixed place,
where they were to deposit their arms and leave the
artillery; to be allowed a free embarkation and passage to
Europe, from Boston, upon condition of their not serving
again in America during the present war; the army not to
be separated, particularly the men from the officers; roll-calling,
and other duties of regularity, to be permitted; the
officers to be admitted on parole, and to wear their sidearms;
all private property to be retained, and the public
delivered upon honor; no baggage to be searched or
molested; all persons, of whatever country, appertaining
to, or following the camp, to be fully comprehended in the
terms of capitulation, and the Canadians to be returned to
their own country, liable to its conditions."</p>

<p>On the day on which the capitulation took place, the
American army numbered nearly fifteen thousand men, ten
thousand of whom were regular troops; the English troops
amounted to five thousand seven hundred and ninety-one,
of whom two thousand four hundred and twelve were Germans,
and three thousand three hundred and seventy-nine
were English.</p>

<p>The munitions of war, which by the capitulation came
into possession of the Americans, were, besides being
numerically great, exceedingly valuable. They consisted
of a fine train of brass artillery, amounting to forty-two
pieces, of different sorts and sizes, four thousand six hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
muskets, and an immense quantity of bombs, balls, and
other implements of war.</p>

<p>Such was the result of this expedition of the British, on
the banks of the Hudson. To the English, it was most
unexpected and disastrous; to the Americans, joyous and
fortunate. It had been planned with ability, and had General
Howe fulfilled the part expected of him, the result
might have been reversed. But his failure to cöoperate, as
contemplated in the plan, left General Burgoyne but little
chance of success.</p>

<p>The victory won, General Gates forthwith dispatched
Colonel Wilkinson to convey the happy tidings to congress.
On entering the hall of session, he approached the speaker,
and said: "The whole British army has laid down arms at
Saratoga; our own, full of vigor and courage, expect your
orders; it is for your wisdom to decide where the country
may still have need of their services."</p>

<p>"To General Gates and his army, congress, by resolution,
expressed their thanks. To the former, in addition,
they voted a gold medal, in commemoration of the proud
achievement. On one side of it, was the bust of the general,
with these words around: <i>Horatio Gates, Duci strenuo</i>;
and in the middle, <i>Comita Americana</i>. On the reverse,
Burgoyne was represented in the attitude of delivering
his sword; and, in the back ground, on the one side and on
the other, were seen the two armies of England and America.
At the top were these words: <i>Salum regionum septentrion</i>;
and at the foot, <i>Hoste ad Saratogam in deditione
accepto</i>. Die XVII. Oct. MDCCLXXVII. It would be
difficult to describe the transports of joy which the news
of this event excited among the Americans. They began
to flatter themselves with a still more happy future; no
one any longer entertained a doubt of independence. All
hoped, and not without reason, that a success of this kind
would at length determine France, and the other European
powers that waited for her example, to declare themselves
in favor of America."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span></p>

<p>To the American people at large, the news of the victory
conveyed the most heartfelt joy. The cloud, which had
long rested upon their hopes, seemed to be breaking away,
and to presage the dawn of a day for which for years they
had prayed and struggled; but which, with all their
efforts, hopes, and prayers, had, until now, appeared distant
and doubtful.</p>

<h4>1. STATE OF AFFAIRS IN ENGLAND.</h4>


<p>The effect produced by the surrender of General Burgoyne,
upon the British cabinet and the nation at large,
was as grievous and depressing, as it had been joyous and
animating to congress and the American people. The
most brilliant success had been anticipated by the former;
the most ignominious result had occurred. The pride of
the nation was humbled, and those who had disapproved of
the war, were now loud in their censures of ministers.</p>

<p>Already had the war cost England twenty thousand men
and thirty millions of money. But more of both were now
needed. Reluctant to ask parliament for a fresh levy, the
ministers, during the recess of that body, near the beginning
of the year 1778, dispatched agents into the different provinces
of the kingdom, to spur the inhabitants to enlist, and
to furnish voluntary contributions to carry on the war.</p>

<p>The success of this plan was only partial&mdash;far less than
anticipated, or the exigencies of the case required. The
citizens of Liverpool and Manchester, however, responded
to the call, and agreed to raise and equip a regiment of one
thousand each. Edinburgh and Glasgow followed their
example. London, as a city, peremptorily refused to raise
troops&mdash;but the friends of the government raised the sum
of twenty thousand pounds.</p>



<h4>2. TREATY WITH FRANCE.</h4>


<p>Not long after the declaration of independence, commissioners
were authorized to bring the subject of a recognition
before the court of Versailles, and to urge the measure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
by such considerations as existed in the case. This they
had done, and continued to do, so long as any prospect of
success existed. At length, despairing of obtaining their
object, they were about to abandon further effort, when the
joyful intimation was communicated to Dr. Franklin, that a
treaty, involving the desired recognition, had been determined
upon by the king and his ministers. On the 6th
of February, 1778, this measure, most auspicious to American
interests, was concluded at Paris. It was signed on
behalf of the king by M. Gerard; and for the United States
by Benjamin Franklin, Silas Deane, and Arthur Lee. The
treaty stipulated&mdash;a thing until then unheard of on the part
of a king&mdash;that the essential and express object of the alliance
was to maintain effectually the <i>liberty</i>, <i>sovereignty</i>,
and <i>independence of the United States</i>.</p>

   <p class="caption2">American Commissioners before the Court of Louis XVI.</p>
</div>

<p>On the 21st of March, the American commissioners were
with great pomp and ceremony, introduced by Count de
Vergennes before the throne, whereon was seated the king,
Louis XVI., in the midst of the grandees of his court.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
The honor was one which was conferred only when the
king gave audience to the ambassadors of sovereigns and
independent states.</p>

<p>On the 2d of May, the French frigate <i>La Sensible</i>, having
on board the important treaty, reached the American
shores. Congress was forthwith convened, and the treaty
was ratified. The most heartfelt joy pervaded the country.
The army, drawn up in the order of battle, received the
intelligence with exultation not to be described.</p>



<h4>3. MOVEMENTS IN THE BRITISH PARLIAMENT.</h4>


<p>Before the treaty between France and the United States
was made public, the British ministry had knowledge of its
existence. Justly alarmed, they felt the necessity of adopting
some measures by which to bring the war to a close,
without a collision with France. What those measures
should be, was a question on which a diversity of opinion
existed in the cabinet. It is asserted, that some of the
members, in secret session, proposed at once to acknowledge
the independence of the United States, and to conclude a
treaty with them. But on the 19th of February, Lord
North introduced a resolution into parliament, admitting
that the parliament could not in future impose any tax or
duty on the colonies of North America, except such only
as should be deemed beneficial to commerce, and the product
even of those to be collected under the authority of
the respective colonies, and to be employed for their use
and advantage. He proposed, besides, that five commissioners
should be appointed, empowered to adjust with any
assembly or individual whatsoever, the differences existing
between Great Britain and her colonies; it being understood,
however, that the compacts were not to take effect
till ratified by the parliament.</p>

<p>To the surprise and indignation of the friends of the war,
the bill passed; and, shortly after, the king appointed for
commissioners the Earl of Carlisle, William Eden, George
Johnstone, and the commander-in-chief of the English army<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
in America. The three first sailed from St. Helena for
America on the 21st, on board the ship Trident.</p>

<p>In the beginning of June, the commissioners arrived, and
on the 9th, repaired to Philadelphia. Soon after, they made
a communication to congress, explanatory of their object,
and requested the privilege of opening a conference with
that body, or with some of its members, either at New
York, or some other place which congress should please to
appoint.</p>

<p>The serious consideration of congress was given to the
overture, and on the 17th of June, their answer was
returned. In substance it was, that they would be ready
to enter upon the consideration of peace and commerce,
not inconsistent with treaties already subsisting, when the
king of Great Britain should demonstrate a sincere disposition
for that purpose; of which no other proof could be
admitted but that of an explicit acknowledgment of the
independence of the United States, or the withdrawal of
his fleets and armies.</p>

<p>Thus terminated the negotiation. America, steady to
her purpose, would not listen to any proposal which did
not involve the recognition of her independence. Great
Britain was yet too proud to accede to such terms, and
consequently, the idea of accommodation was abandoned,
and the most vigorous measures were adopted to wage
war against her ancient ally and her disobedient child,
whose fortunes had now become linked together.</p>

<p>It may be added in this place, that, subsequent to the
failure of the commissioners in effecting the object of their
mission, commenced a system of intrigue with several distinguished
persons, and especially with members of congress,
to whom one at least addressed confidential letters, with the
hope of winning them to the royal cause. Some of these
letters and propositions at length were made public. General
Reed, a member of congress, stated that a proposition
had been made to him by Johnstone, through a <i>lady</i>, that
if he would promote the rëunion of the two countries, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
should have any office in the colonies which he might name.
His reply was worthy of a Christian and a patriot: "<i>I am
not worth purchasing; but such as I am, the king of Great
Britain is not rich enough to do it</i>."</p>



<h4>4. BATTLE OF MONMOUTH.</h4>


<p>During the winter of 1777-8, the British army had occupied
Philadelphia; the winter-quarters of the American
army were at Valley Forge. On the opening of the spring,
in consequence of the alliance of France and America,
orders were issued to the British general to evacuate Philadelphia,
and concentrate the royal force in the city and
harbor of New York. In pursuance of this resolution, the
royal army, now under command of Sir Henry Clinton&mdash;General
Howe having returned to England&mdash;left Philadelphia,
and on the 18th of June, passed the Delaware into
New Jersey.</p>

<p>Washington immediately quitted his camp, and hung
upon the British army, watching a favorable opportunity
to offer battle. On the 27th, the British army encamped
on some high grounds in the neighborhood of Freehold
court-house, in the county of Monmouth.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 28th, General Lee was ordered to
take command of five thousand men, and commence the
attack.</p>

<p>At first, he declined the honor; but judging, on reflection,
that such a procedure would redound to his discredit, he
now sought the command at the hands of Lafayette, to
whom, on his declining it, it had been tendered.</p>

<p>Lee immediately put his troops in motion for the plain of
Monmouth, some four or five miles distant. On approaching
it, the British were already in motion. The army was
in advance of the baggage-train, which covered miles in
extent. The morning was clear, and the sun poured down
his heat so fervidly, as seemingly to cause all nature to
faint. Before noon, the mercury of the thermometer reached
ninety-six. Man and beast panted for breath. The sand-plain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
became parched as an oven, and water was needed at
almost every step. The sufferings of men and horses early
became nearly insupportable.</p>

<p>Moreover, it was the <i>Sabbath</i>&mdash;that day when the hum
of life is ordinarily hushed, and when men are commonly
with their families in the house of God. We may pause,
we trust, to say, that that Sabbath, and the God of that Sabbath,
would have been more honored&mdash;nor do we believe
that the patriot cause would have suffered in the sequel&mdash;had
Washington, instead of sending out a hostile corps&mdash;had
he and his troops spent it in paying divine honors to
the God of our fathers. It had been still better, could
hostile armies have that day grounded their arms, and of
that plain made a sanctuary, and there, in the exercise of
that friendship and love which the gospel enjoins, worshiped
together at a common altar, and before a common Father.
But the latter was not to be expected&mdash;perhaps, not the
former. Other thoughts were occupying those bosoms,
and a far different spectacle was that day to be witnessed.
Let us not judge severely. We will hope that the honor
of God did animate those sons of the Pilgrims. We know
that they were true patriots, and that they were fighting for
their altars and their firesides. Nor is it to be doubted that
they would have preferred the calm and delightful worship
of God, with their families, in the sanctuaries of their own
quiet villages. But they were summoned to the field of
battle, and here, now, we find them soon employed amid
scenes of carnage and death.</p>

<p>Wayne was that day in command under Lee. On seeing
the British train&mdash;horses and waggons, miles in extent&mdash;following
the army in advance, the former, with his detachment,
hastened rapidly forward, with the intent to cut off
and capture the train. Meanwhile, Lee, with the rest of
his division, took a more circuitous route, designing to attack
the corps which had the train in charge. Most unexpectedly,
however, just as he was ready to commence the
charge, intelligence was received that the entire British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
army&mdash;which was on the retreat, but which had had intimation
of Lee's advance&mdash;had wheeled about, and were in
full march to protect its rear.</p>

<p>Lee had reluctantly taken the command; he was in ill-humor,
and, moreover, was probably now appalled at the
prospect before him. At all adventures, greatly to his discredit,
for as yet he had not commenced action, he ordered
a retreat. This movement fell upon Wayne like a thunderbolt,
who was himself compelled, by reason of it, to fall
back, at the hazard of his entire command.</p>

<p>Washington was still at a distance with the remainder of
the army; but was rapidly approaching the theatre of the
contest. The distant cannonade impelled him forward.
The troops, partaking of his own enthusiasm, if not of his
anxiety, laid aside knapsacks&mdash;coats&mdash;all that encumbered,
and amidst dust and heat pressed on to the encounter. At
this moment, a horseman was seen approaching from the
immediate battle-field. He pressed his horse, and made
announcement to Washington that Lee's division, in utter
disorder, was in full retreat. For a moment, the latter
seemed petrified with astonishment; and the next moment&mdash;for
it seems he had for some reason dismounted&mdash;vaulting
upon his saddle, he sprang forward, and like a winged arrow
directed his way to the scene of confusion and flight. The
instant he was seen by the troops in retreat, "The brave
fellows"&mdash;we use the stirring language of Headley&mdash;"the
brave fellows, who had not been half beaten, sent up a shout
that was heard the whole length of the line, and '<i>Long live
Washington!</i>' rent the air. Flinging a hasty inquiry to
Osgood, as to the reason, who replied, '<i>Sir, we are fleeing
from a shadow;</i>' he galloped to the rear, and, reining up
his horse beside Lee, bent on him a face of fearful expression,
and thundered in his ear, as he leaned over his saddle-bow,
'<i>Sir, I desire to know what is the reason, and whence
arises this disorder and confusion!</i>' It was not the words,
but the smothered tone of passion in which they were
uttered, and the manner, which was severe as a blow, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
made this rebuke so terrible. Wheeling his steed, he spurred
up to Oswald's and Stewart's regiments, saying, 'On
you I depend to check this pursuit;' and riding along the
ranks, he roused their courage to the highest pitch by his
stirring appeals; while that glorious shout of '<i>Long live
Washington!</i>' again shook the field. The sudden gust of
passion had swept by; but the storm that ever slumbered
in his bosom was now fairly up; and, galloping about on
his splendid charger, his tall and commanding form towering
above all about him, and his countenance lit up with
enthusiasm, he was the impersonation of all that is great
and heroic in man. In a moment, the aspect of the field
was changed&mdash;the retreating mass halted&mdash;officers were
seen hurrying about in every direction, their shouts and
orders ringing above the roar of the enemy's guns. The
ranks opened&mdash;and, under the galling fire of the British,
wheeled, and formed in splendid order. Washington then
rode back to Lee, and, pointing to the firm front he had
arrayed against the enemy, exclaimed, 'Will you, sir, command
in that place?' He replied, 'Yes.'&mdash;'Well,' then said
he, 'I expect you to check the enemy immediately.' 'Your
orders shall be obeyed,' replied the stung commander, 'and
I will not be the first to leave the field.' The battle then
opened with renewed fury, and Washington hurried back,
to bring his own division into the field."</p>

<p>This took time, as the division was still at a distance.
Meanwhile, however, the retreat was partially staid. The
troops once more rallied. They stood&mdash;they fought&mdash;fought
with unwonted desperation. But the overpowering legions
of the enemy pressed hard. Their shouts were deafening&mdash;their
cannonade appalling and destructive. Lee now
attempted to his utmost power to withstand the impetuous
shock&mdash;but it was entirely beyond the compass of his troops.
They were again giving way. A few moments longer,
and all would be lost. At this critical juncture, Hamilton
appeared, seemingly sent as a messenger from above&mdash;crossing
the field&mdash;his charger covered with foam, and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
hair streaming in the wind&mdash;Hamilton appeared, and riding
up to Lee, said to him: "<i>My dear general, let us die here
rather than retreat.</i>"</p>

<p>What would have been the effect of this soul-stirring and
patriotic address of Hamilton, had no succor been at hand,
we pretend not to say. They were words of comfort and
assurance; and, if necessary to prevent a dishonorable
retreat, there doubtless Hamilton, and perhaps now Lee
himself, would have surrendered up life. But succor was
at hand. Washington with his division had arrived. No
time was lost. He issued his orders, and they were obeyed.
Sterling, Knox, Wayne, brought up their several commands,
and soon the battle was raging, and the whole plains shook
under the clangor of arms and the thunder of artillery.
For a time, few such spectacles were seen during the Revolutionary
war. The heat of the day, we have already said,
was intense. Water was not to be had, or rather there was
no time to quench parched lips, had there been any. Their
thirst added to the sufferings of the troops immeasurably.
The tongues of the soldiers became so inflamed and swollen,
as not to be retained in their mouths. Yet they fought, and
fought with a desperation increased by the very sufferings
they endured. The British suffered from the same causes,
and fought with the same desperation. And for a time, it
was indeed doubtful whose cause would triumph. But the
batteries of Knox and Sterling, like volcanoes, hurled death
and destruction on every side; while the impetuous Wayne
with his columns, torrent-like, spread confusion and dismay
in every step of their progress. There was a concentration
of effort&mdash;and that effort, doubtless the more earnest
and effective, for the reason of the previous unwarranted
and pusillanimous retreat.</p>

<p>In turn, the British themselves now retreated, and encamped
on the spot which Lee's division had occupied in the morning.
They had fought with unwonted zeal. Officers and
soldiers were exhausted. They coveted rest. They needed
repose. It was so with the Americans. "Even Washington's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
powerful frame was overcome by the heat and toil he
had passed through; and as he stood begrimed with the
dust and the smoke of the battle, and wiped his brow, the
perspiration fell in streams from his horse, which looked as
if it had been dragged through a muddy stream, rather
than rode by a living man."</p>

<p>Yet, wearied as he was&mdash;wearied and worn down as
were his officers and men&mdash;Washington could not consent
so to terminate the day. A further duty remained ere he
slept. That duty was to dislodge the enemy from the
position which he had taken. His officers&mdash;his army sympathized
with him; they were willing to put forth one more
effort to secure all that they had promised themselves, and
which in the morning had seemed so practicable.</p>

<p>Two brigades were therefore ordered to attack the British
at their post&mdash;on the right and left. The battle was now
renewed, and renewed with all the spirit and determination
of an earlier hour. It continued, however, but for a brief
period. The sun was fast descending when the second
battle began, and had set ere the several corps had really
attained their proposed positions. It was fortunate, probably,
that the contest was interrupted. Both armies had
done enough. Had Washington succeeded in dislodging
the enemy, his troops were too much spent to have followed
up the victory.</p>

<p>There they now paused. Darkness soon set in. Too
much overcome even to administer to the wants of nature,
the troops of both armies flung themselves upon the parched
ground, and slept. They slept in sight of each other, and
they slept strong and deep. With the morning light, Washington
had decided to renew the battle. He, therefore,
instead of retiring to his marquee, wrapped himself in his
cloak, and sunk upon the earth in the midst of his soldiers.</p>

<p>At the dawn of morning, Washington rose, and with his
recruited followers was about to follow up the advantages
of the preceding day. But the enemy had retired. Aware
of the peril of his condition, the British commander had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
roused his army at midnight, and ordered a retreat. And
so silently was that retreat effected, and so soundly had the
American army slept, officers and men, that no one of the
thousands which composed it, had any suspicion of the
retreat, till the light of day revealed it. Washington was
indeed disappointed; but the departure of the enemy, if it
was not in all respects equal to a victory, gave practical
assurance that Washington had suffered no defeat.</p>

<p>There were doubtless other engagements during the
Revolutionary struggle more brilliant, and of greater influence,
as to the final result, than the battle of Monmouth.
But it is doubtful whether there was a single other one in
which there was a higher exhibition of firmness, or the
practice of greater self-denial, or the endurance of greater
suffering.</p>

<p>Never did commander appear more nobly than did Washington.
But for his presence at the critical moment&mdash;his
quick perception of the danger, and the means of averting
it&mdash;his celerity in issuing his orders&mdash;his manly but terrific
rebuke of Lee&mdash;and perhaps more than all, his undaunted
bravery, and his firm stand when all were flying from a
pursuing foe&mdash;all would indeed have been lost.</p>

<p>For twelve long hours were the respective armies that
day engaged. They numbered about twenty thousand
men. They were on a plain where little or no water could
be obtained, and with a thermometer standing the whole
day at nearly one hundred degrees. Not a few died from
sun-stroke&mdash;and still more from excessive fatigue. The
cry for "<i>water! water!</i>" from the wounded and the dying,
was sufficient to overcome the stoutest heart.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to dwell longer on the particulars of
this remarkable battle. The British troops, as already
intimated, left Washington in occupation of the field. On
the following day, finding his foe gone, he took up his line
of march, and by easy stages moved towards the Hudson.</p>

<p>It does not belong to the plan of our work to pursue the
history of the difficulty which that day arose between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
Washington and Lee, growing out of the retreat of the
latter. That retreat was most unexpected, dishonorable,
and needless. So Washington evidently deemed it, and
this was the occasion of his severe rebuke of that officer in
the field. It has been said that Washington was profane.
That he was greatly excited, calm as he usually was, admits
of no question. That he was profane, is without proof.
Weems says, as quoted by Headley, that as he rode up, he
exclaimed, "For God's sake! General Lee, what is the
cause of this ill-timed prudence?"&mdash;to which the latter
replied, "No man can boast a larger share of that rascally
virtue than your excellency." What reliance, if any, is to
be placed upon the above authority, the writer pretends
not to say. To an inquiry once made of Lafayette, at La
Grange, by Dr. Sparks, what the precise expression of
Washington was, he replied, that although near him at the
moment, he could not have told an hour subsequently. He
thought, however, that it was not so much the expression
itself, as the manner in which it was uttered, that stung the
retreating general. That manner was terrible. The wrath
of Washington was without disguise.</p>

<p>But the results of the day served to meliorate the feelings
of Washington towards Lee, whatever opinion he might
have continued to entertain of his unworthy conduct. It is
said that he rëinstated him in his old command; and had
Lee reciprocated the feelings and kindness of Washington,
the unpleasant occurrence might have passed, and have been
forgotten. But Lee was hot-tempered; and, under the smart
of rebuke, addressed a most ill-judged and "saucy" letter to
Washington, in which he demanded a trial by court-martial.
Washington, in his reply, accused Lee of a breach of orders,
in not attacking the enemy; and a breach of good behavior,
unbecoming an officer of his rank, in so hasty and cowardly
a retreat. Lee rejoined, and in a manner entirely in accordance
with his previous communication. "You cannot," he
wrote, "afford me greater pleasure, sir, than in giving me
an opportunity of showing to America the efficiency of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
respective servants. I trust that the temporary power of
office, and the trivial dignity attending it, will not be able,
by all the mists they can raise, to effusate the bright rays
of truth. In the mean time, your excellency can have no
objection to my retiring from the army."</p>

<p>In whatever light Lee's previous conduct deserved to be
regarded, no doubt could exist as to the intended insult of
Washington conveyed in the above letter. Suffice it to say,
that he was put under immediate arrest; and in August was
tried before a court-martial on three separate charges, viz:
"for disobeying orders, in not attacking the enemy;" "for
making an unnecessary and disorderly retreat;" and "for
disrespect to the commander-in-chief, in two letters."</p>

<p>Of these charges, with a slight modification of one of
them, he was found guilty, and suspended from the army
for twelve months. The decision was most unexpected and
distasteful, as might be supposed, to a man of Lee's ardent
and self-complacential feelings. Washington he never forgave.
Stung by the decision of the court-martial, against
that body&mdash;against congress itself&mdash;he launched his bitter
invectives. At the expiration of his suspension, and while
congress was contemplating his restoration, he addressed
an insulting letter to that body, which hastened his dismission.
We add, only, that he retired to Virginia, where on
a farm he passed the residue of his days.</p>

   <p class="caption2">The Vulture.</p>
</div>

<p>On the night of the 21st of September, 1780, there was
lying at anchor on the Hudson, a few miles below West
Point, a British sloop-of-war, called the <i>Vulture</i>. A little
before midnight, a boat, with muffled oars, and rowed by
two men, put off from the American shore, and proceeded
with great caution towards the sloop. In the stern of the
boat sat a third man, of more consequence than the oarsmen,
and the leader of the secret expedition. It was a
tranquil night; the stars peered out with unwonted lustre,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
and the waters moved slowly down the channel. What
object was proposed by this cautious midnight adventure?
Was intelligence sought from the enemy, or was it to be
imparted to them? Was it a patriotic or a traitorous
expedition?&mdash;The sequel will tell.</p>

<p>Among the brave and chivalrous men who early engaged
in the defence of American rights, was <i>Benedict Arnold</i>.
On the occurrence of the battle of Lexington, he was
residing at New Haven, and was commandant of a company
of militia, called the Governor's Guards.</p>

<p>On the arrival of the news of the above battle at New
Haven, citizens and soldiers, as if moved by a common
impulse, assembled on the green. Fired with indignation,
as were others, Arnold proposed to head such as would
volunteer under him, and lead them to the more immediate
scene of action.</p>

<p>Such was the dispatch of preparation, that the following
day, at the head of sixty volunteers, he was ready to march.</p>

<p>After reaching Cambridge, for a time Arnold was employed
in an expedition against Ticonderoga. About the
time of his return, congress was contemplating a still more
important and hazardous movement against Canada, under
General Schuyler. Believing that essential aid might be
rendered by the way of the Kennebec river, a detachment
of troops was made at Cambridge, the command of which
was tendered to Arnold.</p>

<p>The troops detached for this service amounted to eleven
hundred men&mdash;ten companies of musket-men from New
England, and three companies of rifle-men from Virginia
and Pennsylvania. The field officers were Colonel Arnold,
Lieutenant-colonels Greene and Enos, and Majors Bigelow
and Meigs. The afterwards-celebrated Daniel Morgan
commanded the riflemen. On the 18th of September, the
troops sailed from Newburyport, and rendezvoused at Fort
Western, on the Kennebec, opposite the present town of
Augusta.</p>

<p>From this point they started, and their hardships and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
trials began. No body of troops during the Revolutionary
war, if indeed in the annals of warfare, encountered greater
obstacles, or endured more suffering, than this. The distance
traversed was about two hundred miles, and nearly the
whole of it was a howling wilderness.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="illus-396.jpg" id="illus-396.jpg"></a>
   <img src="images/illus-396.jpg" alt="Arnold's Expedition through the Wilderness." title="Arnold's Expedition through the Wilderness."/>
   <p class="caption2">Arnold's Expedition through the Wilderness.</p>
</div>

<p>On the night of the 14th, Arnold with his men crossed
the St. Lawrence; and, ascending the same abrupt precipice
which Wolfe had climbed before him, formed his small
corps on the heights, near the memorable Plains of Abraham.
But he soon discovered that neither the number nor
condition of his men would justify him in hazarding an
action. Having spent a few days on the heights, and summoned
the town to surrender, without even a response, he
retired twenty miles above Quebec, to wait the arrival of
the troops which were to proceed by the western route,
which were now led by General Montgomery, who had
succeeded General Schuyler, in consequence of the illness
of the latter.</p>

<p>On the 1st of December, Montgomery joined Arnold;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
and on the morning of the 31st occurred the memorable
assault upon Quebec, in which the gallant and lamented
Montgomery fell. Arnold, not less bold and intrepid, had
his leg-bone severely fractured, and was obliged to be carried
from the ground. The issue was disastrous to the
Americans, as is well known; about sixty being killed, and
between three and four hundred taken prisoners. Notwithstanding
his wound and the serious diminution of his force,
Arnold maintained a blockade of the city during a long
and severe Canadian winter.</p>

<p>As a reward for his persevering efforts in conducting his
troops through the wilderness, and for his gallant conduct
in the assault of Quebec, congress promoted Arnold to the
rank of brigadier-general.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="illus-397.jpg" id="illus-397.jpg"></a>
   <img src="images/illus-397.jpg" alt="General Lincoln." title="General Lincoln."/>
   <p class="caption2">General Lincoln.</p>
</div>

<p>In February, 1777, congress appointed five additional
major-generals. According to the usual practice in reference
to promotions, Arnold would have been entitled to this
honor; but those thus promoted were all his juniors, and
one of them, General Lincoln, was taken from the militia.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
To a man like Arnold, ambitious of military glory, such a
neglect could not be otherwise than deeply wounding. In
anticipation of his mortified feelings, Washington addressed
a kind and soothing letter to him, virtually expressing his
disapproval of the course of procedure, and advising Arnold
to demean himself with the magnanimity of a soldier, in
the hope that justice would still be done him, and others,
who were similarly neglected.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Washington addressed to friends in congress
a letter of inquiry on the subject. To this it was replied,
that as each state claimed a number of general officers,
proportioned to the troops it furnished, and as Connecticut
already had two, there existed no vacancy for another.
There was at least plausibility in the reason, but it seems
not to have satisfied Washington; much less could it be
expected to satisfy so sensitive and ambitious a man as
Arnold. This disappointment was probably among the
causes which soured the mind of the latter, and laid the
foundation of those corrodings of the heart, which in after-times
led to the utter ruin of his reputation, and came near
effecting the ruin of his country.</p>

<p>But this was by no means the only ground of Arnold's
complaint. Construing the neglect of congress as an implied
censure of his military conduct in past times&mdash;and perhaps
the inference was not entirely without foundation&mdash;Arnold
resolved to demand of congress an examination into his
conduct. With this object in view, he proceeded to head-quarters,
to solicit of Washington permission to proceed to
Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Just at the time he was passing through Connecticut, a
British force, consisting of two thousand troops, under the
infamous General Tryon, had landed at Compo, between
Fairfield and Norwalk, for the purpose of penetrating to
Danbury, to destroy some public stores, which the Americans
had lodged there.</p>

<p>Arnold heard of this invasion; and, for the time, honorably
foregoing the object of his journey, and roused by that high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
military spirit which in no small degree characterized him,
he immediately turned his course northward, for the purpose
of aiding in repelling the foe.</p>

<p>A militia force of five hundred had been hastily collected
by Generals Wooster and Silliman. These, together with
about one hundred continental troops, Arnold overtook near
Reading, on their march towards Danbury. At Bethel,
information was obtained that the town had been fired, and
the public stores destroyed. The next morning, the generals
divided their forces&mdash;General Wooster, with two hundred
men, falling in the rear of the enemy, while Arnold and
Silliman, with five hundred (their original force having been
augmented), by a rapid movement, took post in their front
at Ridgefield.</p>

   <p class="caption2">Death of General Wooster.</p>
</div>

<p>About eleven o'clock, General Wooster overtook the enemy,
and attacked them with great gallantry. Riding to the
front of his troops, with a design of inspiring them with
appropriate courage, he cried: "Come on, my boys! never
mind such random shot." But scarcely had he uttered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
words, when a fatal ball pierced his side, and this gallant
general fell.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Arnold having reached the north part of the
long street at Ridgefield, barricaded the road with carts,
logs, hay, and earth, presenting a formidable obstruction
to the approaching enemy, and no mean protection to the
resisting force.</p>

</div>

<p>"At three o'clock the enemy appeared, marching in a
solid column, and they commenced a heavy fire as they
advanced towards the breastwork: it was briskly returned.
For nearly a quarter of an hour, the action was warm, and
the Americans maintained their ground, by the aid of their
barricade, against four times their number, until the British
column began to extend itself, and to stretch around their
flanks. This was a signal for retreat. Arnold was the last
man that remained behind. While alone in this situation, a
platoon of British troops, who had clambered up the rocks
on the left flank, discharged their muskets at him. His
horse dropped lifeless; and when it was perceived that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
rider did not fall, one of the soldiers rushed forward with a
fixed bayonet, intending to run him through. Arnold sat
unmoved on his struggling horse, watched the soldier's
approach till he was near enough to make sure his aim,
then drew a pistol from his holsters, and shot him dead.
Seizing this critical opportunity, he sprang upon his feet,
and escaped unharmed. So remarkable an exhibition of
cool and steady courage, in a moment of extreme danger,
has rarely been witnessed.</p>

<p>"He rallied his men, and continued to annoy the enemy
in their progress. Being rëinforced the next day, he hung
upon their flanks and rear throughout the whole march to
their ships, attacking them at every assailable point. In a
skirmish near Compo, just before the British embarked,
the horse which he rode was shot through the neck, and
on all occasions he exposed himself with his accustomed
intrepidity."</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

   <img src="images/illus-401.jpg" alt="General Arnold." title="General Arnold."/>
   <p class="caption2">General Arnold.</p>
</div>

<p>The heroic conduct of Arnold&mdash;periling life as a volunteer,
and while smarting under a sense of wrong&mdash;was duly
appreciated wherever the exploit was told. Congress, sensible
of the merit of the achievement, immediately promoted
him to the rank of major-general; but instead of ante-dating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
his commission, that he might take rank with those who
had been raised above him, they left him still <i>subordinate</i>
to them. This was unfortunate, and even inconsistent.
Arnold felt the neglect with still deeper sensibility, and
saw in it, as he imagined, an undeniable proof that the
charge of ingratitude which he had brought against his
country was well founded.</p>

<p>At length, his complaints were referred to the Board of
War, and the charges of his accusers were examined. The
board reported that they were satisfied with the character
and conduct of General Arnold. This report congress
confirmed. Indeed, they went further, and presented him
with a horse properly caparisoned, in token of their approbation
of his gallant conduct in resisting the troops under
General Tryon. Had they added to this an equality of
rank with the generals who had been raised over him,
Arnold would have been satisfied; but neglecting this&mdash;and
the cause was doubtless to be ascribed to the personal
influence of bitter enemies, who could not forget his arrogance
and presumption&mdash;he was chagrined, rather than
flattered, by the tokens of approbation he had received&mdash;and
soured rather than pacified.</p>

<p>Added to this, Arnold was mortified and exasperated that
his accounts were not fully and promptly allowed by a committee
appointed to audit them. This they could not justly
do without much qualification. They were numerous and
large, many debts incurred were without authority, and
vouchers were wanting. The consequence was a general
suspicion that Arnold intended to enrich himself, or meet
his private extravagant expenditures at the public expense.</p>

<p>Passing over several intervening events, especially the
signal success of General Gates in resisting the progress of
General Burgoyne, during which Arnold acted a part so
heroic, as to be honored by Washington with one of the
three sets of epaulettes and sword-knots which had been
presented to him by a gentleman of France, we reach a
signal event in the life of this remarkable man&mdash;his appointment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
by Washington, in consideration of his disabled condition,
to the command of Philadelphia, following the
evacuation of that city by the British. The station was
honorable, and the duties, though delicate, were not severe.</p>

<p>Several circumstances, about this time, served to weaken
his affections for the patriotic cause. One was the report
of specific charges against him by a committee of congress,
for acts oppressive and unworthy his rank and station, on
which he was tried, and ordered to be reprimanded by the
commander-in-chief.</p>

<p>In performing this duty, Washington exhibited as much
mildness as the case permitted. "Our profession," said he,
"is the chastest of all. The shadow of a fault tarnishes our
most brilliant actions. The least inadvertence may cause
us to lose that public favor, which is so hard to be gained.
I reprimand you for having forgotten that, in proportion as
you had rendered your name formidable to our enemies,
you should have shown moderation towards our citizens.
Exhibit again those splendid qualities which have placed
you in the rank of our most distinguished generals. As far
as it shall be in my power, I will myself furnish you with
opportunities for regaining the esteem which you have
formerly enjoyed."</p>

<p>The decision of the court, and the reprimand of Washington,
mild and delicate as it was, fell heavy on the excitable
spirit of Arnold. A burning revenge rankled in his
bosom, and from this time&mdash;if his traitorous purposes had
not before been formed&mdash;he sought opportunities to gratify
his malice, and at the same time the sordid passion of
avarice, which had long held sway in his bosom.</p>

<p>Another circumstance, besides contributing to his expenses,
operated to separate his affections from the patriotic
cause. He had married a beautiful and accomplished lady,
during his residence in Philadelphia, a daughter of Mr.
Edward Shippen, a family of distinguished rank; and which,
like others of a similar stamp in that city, was intimate with
Sir William Howe, Major Andre, and other British officers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
during their occupation of Philadelphia. This alliance
brought Arnold, as a matter of course, into associations
with persons who were attached to the royal cause, and
who were ready to foster his prejudices, and justify his
complaints of ingratitude and persecution.</p>

<p>At length, he matured a plan&mdash;confined for a time to his
own bosom&mdash;dark, base, and traitorous&mdash;as it were the
offspring of the nether world.</p>

<p>To the accomplishment of this plan, it was necessary
that he should be appointed to the command of West
Point, a fortress on the Hudson. With consummate art, he
accomplished his purpose; and, at the hands of Washington,
to whom he had been indebted more than to any other,
for standing by him as a shelter during his stormy life, he
received the appointment; soon after which, he repaired to
the Highlands, and established his head-quarters at Robinson's
house, two or three miles below West Point, on the
opposite, or eastern bank of the river.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="illus-404.jpg" id="illus-404.jpg"></a>
   <img src="images/illus-404.jpg" alt="Major Andre." title="Major Andre."/>
   <p class="caption2">Major Andre.</p>
</div>

<p>Previous to her marriage, Mrs. Arnold had been acquainted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
with Major Andre, and had corresponded with him after that
event, and after his removal with the British forces to New
York. Acquainted with this correspondence, Arnold took
the opportunity presented by it to address, unknown to his
wife, letters to Sir Henry Clinton, through Andre, under
the signature of <i>Gustavus</i>, and Andre replied under the
assumed name of <i>John Anderson</i>. This correspondence had
been carried on for months before Arnold's appointment to
West Point. For a time, Clinton was at a loss to imagine
the real character behind the curtain; but, at length, he
became convinced that it could be no other than Arnold
himself. Hitherto, that general had treated <i>Gustavus</i> with
cautious indifference, but no sooner was Arnold promoted
to the command of West Point, than Clinton was ready to
enter into negotiation with him to surrender that fortress
into the hands of the British, and almost at any price which
Arnold might choose to name.</p>

<p>The first plan devised for bringing about an interview
between Arnold and Andre failed, but a second proved
more successful. The Vulture, a sloop-of-war, with Colonel
Robinson on board, came up the river about the 16th of
September. On their arrival at Teller's Point, Robinson,
who was a tory, and whose property had been confiscated
by the state of New York, addressed a letter to <i>General
Putnam</i>, relating to the recovery of his property, and forwarded
it under cover of a letter to Arnold by a flag-boat.
Putnam was known not to be in that quarter, but the letter
to him served as a pretext to enable Robinson to communicate
a plan, by which an interview could be effected.</p>

<p>Arnold, by means of consummate art and duplicity, had
engaged a Mr. Smith, a man of respectable standing, to go
on board the Vulture, and convey a gentleman there to the
American shore, who would impart intelligence to him of
the greatest importance to the American cause. Smith had
been employed in procuring intelligence from time to time
from New York for Arnold's predecessor at West Point,
and at length consented to perform the service solicited by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
Arnold; and, that his family might not be privy to the
transaction, they were removed to Fishkill, under pretence
of a visit to some friends.</p>

<p>Thus matters were arranged; and on the night of the
21st, Smith, with two oarsmen, bribed to secresy by the
promise of fifty pounds each, left the American shore, and
proceeded, as related in the commencement of this account,
to the Vulture.</p>

<p>Andre was expecting Arnold himself. Not finding him
on board, but receiving a letter putting him on his guard,
and inviting him to return in the boat, for a time he hesitated.
Robinson was still firmer in the opinion that he
should not go. But, at length, the adventurous spirit of
Andre decided the point; and having cautiously concealed
his uniform in a great-coat, he stepped on board the boat,
which immediately proceeded towards the American shore.
They landed at the foot of a mountain, called Long Clove,
about six miles below Stony Point.</p>

<p>Arnold was in the bushes, ready to receive the stranger.
Smith had expected to be present at the interview, and was
not only disappointed, but exasperated, in being refused.
What a spot! what a conference! what a deep and traitorous
planning in midnight darkness!</p>

<p>The interview was long, and the patience of Smith was
exhausted, but more his fears were roused. The night was
far spent, and the dawning of the day was at hand. He
now made known his apprehensions to the midnight traitors;
but as they had not perfected their business, Smith and his
oarsmen were allowed to retire.</p>

<p>No sooner were they gone, than Arnold proposed that
Andre should proceed with him to Smith's house, and leave
the manner of his return to future deliberation. This plan
was replete with hazard; but no alternative presenting itself,
Andre reluctantly followed. Judge his surprise, when, on
approaching the American lines, a sentinel hailed them, and
demanded the countersign. Andre shuddered. Arnold gave
the sign, and they passed on. Andre was now, contrary to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
all his determinations, within the American lines, on dangerous
ground, where his life and fortunes hung, as it were,
upon the cast of a die.</p>

<p>Arnold and Andre reached Smith's about the dawn of
day. Soon after, the latter made his appearance. An incident
now occurred, which added to the anxiety of Andre.
The sound of cannon broke upon them, which, on proceeding
to a window overlooking the river, was ascertained to
be from the American shore; and from the movements of
the Vulture soon after down the stream, it was inferred that
the fire was against her. So it proved. Believing her to
lie in the river for no good purpose, Colonel Livingston had
directed a fire to be opened upon her, which caused the
movement observed. Andre now felt the delicacy of his
situation still more, and the difficulty of his return to the
sloop to be still greater.</p>

<p>But the duties of his mission required attention, and to its
completion the plotters betook themselves. It was finally
settled. The British, on a given day, were to dispatch a
fleet up the river with the requisite troops: and Arnold, in
order to render the seizure of the fortress easy, was previously
to withdraw the garrison, and station them at different
points in the neighborhood, in small detachments. In consideration
of the surrender, the traitor was to receive a
large amount of "British gold."</p>

<p>Having completed these nefarious negotiations, the manner
in which Andre should return, next engrossed their
deliberations. This was a question of difficult solution.
Andre insisted on being put on board the Vulture; Smith
was unwilling to run the hazard. Before the question was
decided, Arnold left for West Point, giving to Andre passports
accommodated to the manner in which it might finally
be decided that he should return.</p>

<p>Andre spent the day in an upper room at Smith's&mdash;a long
and anxious day. Towards its close, he urged Smith to
take him on board the Vulture; but to his surprise and
distress, the former peremptorily refused, but offered to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
accompany him on horseback to some point of safety. No
other alternative presenting itself, Andre consented; and,
having changed his military coat for a citizen's dress, over
which throwing his great-coat, they departed.</p>

<p>Between eight and nine o'clock, they were startled by
the hail of a sentinel, who ordered them to stop. "Who
commands here?" inquired Smith, dismounting, and approaching
the sentinel. The commander, Captain Boyd,
being himself within hearing distance, approached, and
demanded who the stranger was, and whither bound.
Smith, ignorant of the real character of Andre, answered
as Arnold had dictated; and, moreover, added that he had
a pass from the general. Boyd required a sight of the pass,
on perusing which, his curiosity was still more excited, and
he now in private questioned Smith with still greater particularity.
Smith explained the matter as well as he was
able; and, by several adroit fabrications, finally induced
Boyd to consent to their continuing their journey; not,
however, until morning, for fear, as he pretended, they
might be waylaid by the Cow-boys.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> Andre would have
purchased a release from tarrying in the neighborhood that
night at any price, had he had the means; but such an
overture would have been fraught with danger, and therefore,
bending to necessity, they repaired to one Miller's,
where they passed the night&mdash;a night of dread and fearful
anticipation.</p>

<p>At early dawn, in order to escape the further scrutiny of
Boyd, they were on their journey. At the distance of about
a couple of miles from Pine's bridge, they halted, took
breakfast, and separated&mdash;Smith setting out on his return,
and Andre continuing his journey. Andre had now nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
thirty miles to traverse ere he was on safe ground. He
had been recommended to proceed by the way of White
Plains; but, on crossing the above bridge, deeming the
Tarrytown road more safe, he took that, and for a time
passed on without molestation.</p>

<p>Two plundering parties were abroad that morning from
the "neutral ground;" one of which, consisting of John
Paulding, Daniel Williams, and Isaac Van Wart, had concealed
themselves in some bushes near the road which
Andre was passing, watching there for some valuable prey.</p>

<p>Andre approached the spot; upon which, Paulding rose,
and presenting his firelock to his breast, bid him stand.
"Gentlemen," said Andre, "I hope you belong to our party."
"I asked him"&mdash;we follow the testimony of Paulding on
the trial of Smith&mdash;"what party? He said, 'The lower
party.' Upon that I told him I did. Then he said, 'I am
a British officer out of the country on particular business,
and I hope you will not detain me a minute;' and to show
that he was a British officer, he pulled out his watch. Upon
which, I told him to dismount. He then said, 'My God! I
must do any thing to get along;' and seemed to make a
kind of laugh of it, and pulled out General Arnold's pass,
which was to John Anderson, to pass all guards to White
Plains and below. Upon that, he dismounted. Said he,
'Gentlemen, you had better let me go, or you will bring
yourselves into trouble, for your stopping me will detain
the general's business;' and said he was going to Dobb's
ferry, to meet a person there, and get intelligence for General
Arnold. Upon that, I told him I hoped he would not
be offended, that we did not mean to take any thing from
him; and I told him there were many bad people who were
going along the road, and I did not know but perhaps he
might be one."</p>

<p>Williams testified as follows: "We took him into the
bushes, and ordered him to pull off his clothes, which he
did; but on searching him narrowly, we could not find any
sort of writings. We told him to pull off his boots, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
he seemed to be indifferent about; but we got one boot off,
and searched in that boot, and could find nothing. But we
found there were some papers in the bottom of his stocking
next to his foot; on which we made him pull his stocking
off, and found three papers wrapped up. Mr. Paulding
looked at the contents, and said he was a spy. We then
made him pull off his other boot, and there we found three
more papers at the bottom of his foot within his stocking."</p>

<p>After consultation, it was decided to take the prisoner to
North Castle, where Lieutenant-colonel Jameson commanded
a detachment of dragoons. Having surrendered
him to Jameson, the latter for a time hesitated what disposition
to make of him. The papers found upon Andre were
important&mdash;in the hand-writing of Arnold, and endorsed
by him.</p>

<p>Most men would have suspected treason&mdash;nor would
Arnold himself have escaped suspicion. Yet Jameson, at
length, decided to forward the papers to Washington by
express, and the prisoner to Arnold. These measures had
been taken, when Major Talmadge, next in command to
Jameson, returned from an excursion to White Plains. On
learning the incidents of the day, he expressed his surprise,
and begged Jameson to dispatch a counter-order, if possible,
to bring back the prisoner and the papers.</p>

<p>To the foregoing, Jameson finally consented, but the
papers were left to be conveyed to Washington. Andre
was overtaken and brought back. Talmadge, being a sagacious
observer, marked Andre&mdash;his walk&mdash;his military air&mdash;his
dignified bearing&mdash;and decided that the prisoner was no
ordinary man. Shortly after, under escort of Talmadge,
Andre was removed to Lower Salem, to await the developments
of time and the orders of Washington.</p>

<p>The morning after their arrival at Salem, Andre requested
paper and ink, and soon presented to Talmadge an open
letter addressed to Washington, with a request that he
would himself read and forward it.</p>

<p>This letter, couched in most respectful language, communicated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
to Washington his name, and rank in the British
army, and his object in coming within the American lines.</p>

<p>It so happened&mdash;a wonderful interposition of Divine
Providence, who can doubt?&mdash;it so happened, that on the
very day that Andre wrote his letter, Washington, on his
return from Hartford, arrived at Fishkill, eighteen miles
from Arnold's head-quarters. Contrary to his previous
intentions, he was induced to remain there during the night.
In the morning, an express was dispatched early to give
notice to General Arnold, that the party would reach his
quarters to breakfast.</p>

<p>Washington and his suite followed soon after, and on
coming to the road which led off to Robinson's house&mdash;Arnold's
residence&mdash;Washington was proceeding towards
the river. Being informed of his mistake, he observed that
as he must inspect the redoubts on this side the river, he
himself would forego Mrs. Arnold's breakfast, but his suite
might pass on, and enjoy it. They would not, however,
leave their general; and all, excepting his aids, who were
sent forward to make his excuse, proceeded towards the
river.</p>

<p>On learning that General Washington would not be there
to breakfast, General Arnold and family, with the aids, proceeded
to the breakfast-table.</p>

<p>That was the last peaceful meal Arnold was to enjoy in
this world&mdash;and even the peace of that was invaded, before
they were ready to leave the table. A messenger entered
with a letter from Jameson&mdash;the letter which first announced
the capture of Andre.</p>

<p>It fell as a thunderbolt upon the traitor. Yet he so far
concealed his agitation before the aids, as to prevent serious
suspicion that any thing uncommon had occurred. A sudden
emergency called him to West Point, he said, and he
begged to be excused. Having ordered a horse, he
requested Mrs. Arnold's presence in her chamber, and here
in few words informed her of the necessity of his fleeing
for his life. He left her fainting on the floor; and, mounting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
put spurs to his horse, directing his course to the river,
on reaching which, he entered a boat, and fabricating a
story to his purpose, ordered the men to proceed to the
Vulture. The promise of reward gave impulse to their
energies, and Arnold was soon safely on board of the royal
sloop.</p>

   <p class="caption2">Interview of Arnold and his Wife.</p>
</div>

<p>Washington having completed his inspection of the
redoubts, reached Arnold's soon after his departure. Understanding
that he had gone to West Point, after a hasty
breakfast, Washington and suite followed. But what was
his surprise to learn that Arnold had not been there. After
a cursory view of the fortress, the party returned to Arnold's.
Meanwhile, the messenger from Colonel Jameson, with
Andre's papers, had arrived.</p>

<p>Light was now shed upon the mystery. Arnold was a
traitor, and had fled to the enemy. Measures were immediately
taken to secure the fortress. An express was dispatched
to Salem, with orders to have Andre conveyed to
Arnold's house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us hasten to the conclusion. On the 29th of September,
Washington ordered a Board of Inquiry, consisting
of six major and eight brigadier generals. After a full
hearing of the facts, the Board reported that Major Andre
ought to be considered as a spy, and, according to the laws
and usages of nations, to suffer death.</p>

<p>The decision, though just, was painful&mdash;painful to Washington&mdash;to
the Board&mdash;to the officers of the American army&mdash;but
more painful, if possible, to Sir Henry Clinton and
the companions of Andre in arms.</p>

<p>Efforts, and such as did honor to Clinton, were made to
reverse the doom of Andre. <i>Intimations</i> were given from
Washington, that upon one condition&mdash;the surrender of
Arnold&mdash;Andre might be released; but to this, Clinton
thought he could not in honor yield&mdash;while in the scale of
affection, Andre would have outweighed a thousand traitors
like Arnold. A deputation from Clinton repaired to Robinson's
house under a flag, to urge the release of Andre, but
no change could be effected in the mind of Washington.</p>

<p>Sentence of execution issued, and five o'clock, of the 1st
day of October, was appointed for carrying it into effect.
On the morning of that day, Andre addressed a letter to
Washington, requesting that he might be allowed a soldier's
death.</p>

<p class="signature">
"<i>Tappan</i>, 1<i>st October</i>, 1780.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>: Buoyed above the terror of death, by the consciousness
of a life devoted to honorable pursuits, and stained with
no action that can give me remorse, I trust that the request
I make to your excellency, at this serious period, and which
is to soften my last moments, will not be rejected.</p>

<p>"Sympathy towards a soldier will surely induce your
excellency, and a military tribunal, to adapt the mode of
my death to the feelings of a man of honor.</p>

<p>"Let me hope, sir, that if aught in my character impresses
you with esteem towards me&mdash;if aught in my misfortune
marks me as the victim of policy, and not of resentment&mdash;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
shall experience the operations of those feelings in your
breast, by being informed that I am not to die on a gibbet.</p>

<p>"I have the honor to be your excellency's most obedient
and most humble servant,</p>

<p class="signature">
"<span class="smcap">John Andre.</span>"
</p>

<p>To this request, Washington could not consistently accede,
but to avoid needless pain, he omitted to make a reply.</p>

<p>The execution finally took place October 2d, at twelve
o'clock&mdash;a delay having been occasioned by pending negotiations,
which could not be terminated in season the previous
day.</p>

<p>Dr. Thatcher, in his 'Military Journal,' has given the
closing particulars of this tragic scene. It follows:</p>

<p>"The principal guard-officer, who was constantly in the
room with the prisoner, relates, that when the hour of his
execution was announced to him in the morning, he received
it without emotion; and while all present were affected with
silent gloom, he retained a firm countenance, with calmness
and composure of mind. Observing his servant enter the
room in tears, he exclaimed, 'Leave me till you can show
yourself more manly.' His breakfast being sent to him
from the table of General Washington, which had been
done every day of his confinement, he partook of it as
usual; and having shaved and dressed himself, he placed his
hat on the table, and cheerfully said to the guard-officers,
'I am ready at any moment, gentlemen, to wait on you.'
The fatal hour having arrived, a large detachment of troops
was paraded, and an immense concourse of people assembled;
almost all our general and field officers, excepting his
excellency and his staff, were present on horseback; melancholy
and gloom pervaded all ranks; the scene was affecting
and awful.</p>

<p>"I was so near during the solemn march to the fatal spot,
as to observe every movement, and participate in every
emotion which the melancholy scene was calculated to produce.
Major Andre walked from the stone house, in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
he had been confined, between two of our subaltern officers,
arm in arm; the eyes of the immense multitude were fixed
on him, who, rising superior to the fear of death, appeared
as if conscious of the dignified deportment which he displayed.
He betrayed no want of fortitude, but retained a
complacent smile on his countenance, and politely bowed
to several gentlemen whom he knew, which was respectfully
returned. It was his earnest desire to be shot, as
being the mode of death most conformable to the feelings
of a military man, and he had indulged the hope that his
request would be granted. At the moment, therefore,
when suddenly he came in view of the gallows, he involuntarily
started backward, and made a pause. 'Why this
emotion, sir?' said an officer by his side. Instantly recovering
his composure, he said, 'I am reconciled to my death,
but I detest the mode.'</p>

<p>"While waiting, and standing near the gallows, I observed
some degree of trepidation; placing his foot on a stone, and
rolling it over, and choking in his throat, as if attempting to
swallow. So soon, however, as he perceived that things
were in readiness, he stepped quickly into the wagon, and
at this moment he appeared to shrink; but instantly elevating
his head with firmness, he said, 'It will be but a momentary
pang;' and taking from his pocket two white handkerchiefs,
the provost-marshal with one loosely pinioned his arms, and
with the other, the victim, after taking off his hat and stock,
bandaged his own eyes with perfect firmness, which melted
the hearts, and moistened the cheeks, not only of his servant,
but of the throng of spectators. The rope being appended
to the gallows, he slipped the noose over his head, and
adjusted it to his neck, without the assistance of the executioner.
Colonel Scammell now informed him that he had
opportunity to speak, if he desired it. He raised the handkerchief
from his eyes, and said: 'I pray you to bear me
witness, that I meet my fate like a brave man.' The wagon
being now removed from under him, he was suspended, and
instantly expired."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus was cut off in the morning of life a man full of
promise and expectation&mdash;one to whose personal attractions
were added accomplishments, rich, varied, and brilliant&mdash;destined,
but for an untimely sacrifice of himself, under the
impulse of a forbidden ambition, to have reached the goal
of his wishes&mdash;honor and renown. His death at the hands
of the Americans, according to the usage of war, was just;
but to Arnold, the pioneer in the base transaction, the news
of his execution must, it would seem, have been as the bitterness
of death.</p>

<p>But no:&mdash;Arnold had no such feelings. Conscience was
seared; the generous sympathies of our nature were extinct;
even the honor of a soldier, dearer to him than life itself, had
expired. The long-cherished, deep-rooted, sordid passion
of his soul&mdash;<i>avarice</i>&mdash;alone lived; and now, while Andre,
who might almost be said to be the victim of that nether
spirit, was mouldering in an untimely and dishonored grave,
he demanded his <i>pay</i>. What must Clinton&mdash;the friend and
patron of the high-souled and magnanimous Andre&mdash;have
felt when he told out to Arnold <i>six thousand three hundred
and fifteen pounds</i>, as the reward of his treachery!</p>

<p>In addition to this pecuniary reward, Arnold received the
commission of brigadier-general in the British army. But,
after his infamous attack on New London, and his inhuman
conduct to the brave Ledyard and his garrison in Fort
Trumbull, finding himself neglected by the British officers,
he obtained permission to retire to England, for which he
sailed in 1781 with his family.</p>

<p>The life of Arnold was prolonged twenty years beyond
this date. But although the king and a few others in office
felt compelled to notice him for a time, yet they, at length,
were willing to forget him, while others despised and shunned
him. Colonel Gardiner says, that when a petition for
a bill authorizing a negotiation of peace was presented to
the king, Arnold was standing near the throne. Lauderdale
is reported to have declared, on his return to the House of
Commons, that, however gracious the language he had heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>
from the throne, his indignation could not but be highly
excited at beholding, as he had done, his majesty supported
by a traitor. And on another occasion, Lord Surrey, rising
to speak in the House of Commons, and perceiving Arnold
in the gallery, immediately sat down, exclaiming: "I will
not speak while that man (pointing to him) is in the house."</p>

<p>Not long after the war, Arnold removed to St. John's, in
New Brunswick, where he engaged for a time in the West
India trade. Subsequently, he returned to England, where
he resided to the time of his death, which occurred in London,
June 14th, 1804.</p>

<p>We must hasten to the closing scenes of the long and
sanguinary contest between Great Britain and America.</p>

<p>The capture of Burgoyne, in 1777, was hailed, by a portion
of the American people, as indicative of a speedy
termination of the war. But, in these anticipations, they
were destined to be disappointed. For several years following,
although the contest was still continued, but little
advance was made towards the termination. Battles were
indeed fought, naval engagements occurred, and predatory
enterprises were planned, and executed with various success;
but neither power could be said at any one period to
be decidedly in the ascendant. In 1779, the theatre of war
was changed from the northern to the southern section of
the confederacy. To this change, the British were invited
by the prospect of an easier victory. That portion of the
country was rendered weak by its scattered population,
by the multitude of slaves, and by the number of tories
intermingled with the citizens.</p>

<p>Partial success to the British arms was the consequence.
Savannah was taken possession of, which gave the enemy,
for a time, the power in Georgia. In like manner, Charleston
fell into their hands, and with it, a considerable portion
of the state of South Carolina. In the progress of this
southern warfare, battles occurred at Camden&mdash;at the Cowpens&mdash;at
Guilford Court-house&mdash;and at Eutaw Springs.</p>



<h4>1. SIEGE OF SAVANNAH.</h4>


<p>In the autumn of 1778, Savannah fell into the hands of
the British. At that time, Colonel Campbell, with a force<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
of two thousand men, was dispatched by Governor Clinton
from New York against that city. The American garrison,
under General Howe, consisting of but six hundred
continental troops and a small body of militia, was inadequate
to resist so formidable a force; and at the expiration
of a spirited action, in which the Americans suffered
severely, the latter surrendered, and with that surrender,
the British took military occupation of the capital itself.</p>

<p>The succeeding year, D'Estaing, with a French fleet,
destined to cöoperate with the Americans for the recovery
of Savannah, arrived on the coast of Georgia. This intelligence
having been communicated to General Lincoln,
who was in the vicinity of Charleston with a small force,
he immediately broke up his camp, and marched to assist in
the disembarkation of the French troops.</p>

<p>Before the arrival of Lincoln, D'Estaing had sent a
"haughty summons" to Prevost, the English commander, to
surrender. The safety of the former depended upon rëinforcements,
which he was daily expecting; and, in order to
attain a delay, he required twenty-four hours to consider
the question of a capitulation. Unfortunately, D'Estaing
acceded to this demand. This proved fatal to the expedition;
for, meanwhile, Prevost was not idle. He succeeded
in mounting nearly one hundred cannon, and, moreover, the
expected rëinforcement arrived, swelling his force to three
thousand men; upon which, he replied to the French commander,
that he was resolved to hold out to the last.</p>

<p>The original plan of attempting the place by storm was
now prudently abandoned, and the slow process of its
reduction by siege was resolved upon. The combined
forces numbered between six and seven thousand men. The
siege was commenced. Trenches were opened, and, by
the 4th of September, a sap had been pushed to within
three hundred yards of the abbatis. In the course of a
another month, batteries had been erected, and other
preparations were ready.</p>

<p>On the evening of October 4th, the tragical scene commenced,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
and a heavy cannonade was kept up during the
night. In the morning, that scene became terrific. Thirty-seven
cannon and nine mortars were opened upon the city,
while sixteen heavy guns from the fleet added their uproar
to the thunder of the former. The response to these was
still louder and more appalling. Nearly one hundred guns,
which had been mounted by Prevost, as we have said, gave
back their tremendous explosions. Carcasses, filled with
all manner of combustibles, were hurled into the town, setting
on fire the houses, and spreading consternation among
the inhabitants. Shells came down from the sky, bursting
like meteors, and scattering their death-dealing fragments
in every street and in the neighborhood of every dwelling.
All that day, and, indeed, for four succeeding days and
nights, this mutual tremendous firing was maintained.
Savannah and its neighborhood became covered with a
dense, dark cloud of smoke, through which the rays of the
sun could scarcely penetrate by day, and which, as that set,
served as a pall to increase the gloom and darkness of
the night.</p>

<p>If the besiegers were steady to their purpose, the
besieged were no less resolute and successful in their
resistance. Little or no impression had hitherto been
made upon the enemy's works, and how long they would
continue to hold out, the Americans had no means of judging.
They had reason, indeed, to believe that a reduction
might at no distant day be effected, as the supplies were
cut off, and the inhabitants must be suffering intensely.
But D'Estaing began to fear for the safety of his fleet,
exposed, as it was, on an open coast. In this posture, he
proposed to Lincoln to attempt the place as originally contemplated&mdash;by
storm. This the latter deemed extremely
hazardous; but submitting to the higher authority of the
count, an assault was fixed for the 9th of October.</p>

<p>At one o'clock of the morning of that day, the Americans
were up, and ready for the fearful contest. The
French unwisely delayed for some two or three hours;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
but at length, led on by D'Estaing and Lincoln, the combined
forces&mdash;the French in three columns and the Americans
in one&mdash;proceeded to the attack.</p>

<p>Taking a position at the head of the first column,
D'Estaing led them forward to the very walls of the English
works. It was a fatal approach. Of a sudden, and
when the French commander was congratulating himself
that he was taking the enemy by surprise, the blaze of a
hundred cannon filled him and his troops with amazement,
while the balls and grape-shot mowed down their ranks, as
did the fire of the Americans at Bunker's hill. Still,
D'Estaing ordered the remainder to advance, he himself
heroically leading the way. But it was only to death and
defeat. Soon wounded, D'Estaing was borne from the
spot, while his brave troops remained to meet a still
severer destiny. They were mowed as grass by a new-ground
scythe. The few who survived, now made good
their retreat to an adjoining wood, leaving room for the
second column, pressing forward, to supply their place.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="illus-422.jpg" id="illus-422.jpg"></a>
   <img src="images/illus-422.jpg" alt="Jasper on the Ramparts." title="Jasper on the Ramparts."/>
   <p class="caption2">Jasper on the Ramparts.</p>
</div>

<p>These, passing over the fallen bodies of their brave companions,
succeeded in mounting the walls; and there they
stood&mdash;and there, with almost superhuman strength and
determination, they fought. But it was not even for such
bravery and such perseverance to succeed. If the struggle
was now fearful, the carnage was still more so. One after
another, and by tens and twenties, they fell side by side,
companions in death of their brave precursors. A remnant
only was left; and as that remnant succeeded in securing
a retreat, the third and last column of the French troops
came into action. A similar contest awaited them, which
they entered into with even greater ardor and more excited
passion; but it was followed by a similar, and perhaps still
more fatal, result. The chivalrous Laurens, at the head of
the Americans, now made his appearance; and directing his
entire force against the Spring-hill redoubt, attempted to
scale its ramparts. But it was a vain attempt. The parapets
were too high to be reached, and the assailants fell as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
they appeared, shot down with equal certainty and rapidity.
Among the Americans, at this memorable contest, was that
Carolina regiment which, at the siege of Fort Moultrie, had
so distinguished itself, and which, as a reward for its valor,
Mrs. Elliott had presented two standards, as we had occasion
to notice, when describing the noble defence of the old
"slaughter pen." Nothing daunted by the fate of their
companions, this regiment pressed furiously forward; and
now, for a brief period, was witnessed a spectacle, which
lighted up gladness in every eye: two American standards&mdash;the
very standards which we have named&mdash;were seen
waving on the English ramparts. And there, too, was the
noble-hearted Jasper himself, with those standards, which
he loved better than life itself. But it was a momentary
floating to the breeze, and these standards had for ever done
their duty. They soon fell, and with them fell the brave
and patriotic Jasper. He grasped his standard as he fell
into the ditch, and there the flag covered him as a winding-sheet
of glory. He had told Mrs. Elliott that he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
surrender his flag only with his life, and he was true to his
word. Jasper's name&mdash;heroism&mdash;patriotism&mdash;will descend
with the lapse of years; nor will they be remembered but to
be honored, while the records of American valor shall have
an existence.</p>

<p>The issue may be told in few words. The Americans
failed, and retired. Many a noble heart had shed its blood;
many an arm, which had that day</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Shed fast atonement for its first delay,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>was folded on the breast in death. And among those who
fell nobly, there was one&mdash;a high-souled Polander&mdash;the
chivalric Pulaski&mdash;a volunteer in the American service; he
fell at the head of two hundred horsemen, urging on their
way amid fire and smoke, until a swivel-shot struck the
gallant soldier to the earth.</p>

<p>The contest lasted a little more than an hour; and yet,
in that brief space, six hundred and thirty-seven French,
and four hundred and fifty Americans, were mangled&mdash;bleeding
corpses on the ground&mdash;more than one thousand!
Rapid work! It should seem that Moloch might have been
satisfied with the victims offered on that day's altar.</p>

<p>D'Estaing retired soon after with his fleet. He had
gained no praise: on the contrary, he was censured for his
haste in demanding the surrender of Savannah before the
arrival of Lincoln; and then, by allowing Prevost so long
a time to deliberate, in truth giving him ample opportunity
to prepare for defence. The result was inglorious, and
served to perpetuate, and even strengthen, the cause of the
English at the South.</p>



<h4>2. SIEGE OF CHARLESTON.</h4>


<p>Charleston had long been an object of cupidity on the
part of the British. We have already had occasion to
speak of an expedition under Sir Peter Parker and Generals
Cornwallis and Howe, destined against that city,
and the summary check they received at Fort Moultrie&mdash;that
"old slaughter-pen"&mdash;every one of whose garrison was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
a hero, and the record of whose combined resistance can
never be remembered but to the honor and praise of American
valor. That repulse was not forgotten by the British,
and, when next an attempt should be made, it was to be
expected that preparations would be commensurate with
the magnitude and difficulties of the enterprise.</p>

<p>It proved so. In the spring following the siege of
Savannah, General Clinton left New York with ten thousand
men, intent on the capture of Charleston. Lincoln
was still at the head of the American troops in the South.
But they were altogether inadequate to defend the city
against so numerous and formidable a force as now
appeared against him. For his own credit, as well as
for the honor of the American arms, clearly he should have
avoided a collision. But, over-persuaded by Governor
Rutledge and other prominent citizens, and, moreover,
reluctant to abandon a place which contained large public
stores, or seem to yield where there was hope of success,
he consented to remain, and accomplish whatever human
wisdom, combined with American valor, could do.</p>

<p>On the 30th of March, General Clinton commenced the
siege. He proceeded with a caution, to be explained only
by the lesson taught the British at the siege of Fort Moultrie,
and a determination not to be under the necessity of
meeting with another such disastrous result. In another
place, it should have been noted, that Fort Moultrie, in the
present invasion, made no resistance, the contest, it being
intended, should be on the mainland, and in the immediate
vicinity of the city, where such defences had been erected
as the authorities were able to provide.</p>

<p>On the 10th of April, the first parallel was completed, and
Lincoln was summoned to surrender. To this summons,
he replied: "that he felt it to be his duty, and it was also
his instruction, to defend the place to the last extremity."
Ten days elapsed, during which a second parallel was
finished, and a second summons made and declined. A
heavy and formidable cannonade was now opened by Clinton,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
which was kept up, with scarcely any remission, for
several days. Meanwhile, Lincoln was almost constantly
on duty&mdash;straining every muscle to resist the steady, but
apparently fatal, advance of his foe. It is related of him,
that "one day he was ten hours in the saddle, without once
dismounting&mdash;riding hither and thither, with his great heart
filled with anxious foreboding; and, the last fortnight, he
never took off his clothes to rest. Flinging himself, in his
uniform, on a couch, he would snatch a few moments'
repose, and then again be seen riding along the lines."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, his defences became weakened, and his
troops exhausted with labor and fatigue. They had little
time to sleep, and even the supply of provisions was limited.
Yet, Lincoln continued, day after day, to inspire them with
courage and hope. All that a brave commander could do,
he did&mdash;concealing the apprehensions which harrowed his
inmost soul, and for which there were reasons; all that
men could do, his noble few did&mdash;suffering privations seldom
experienced during the revolutionary contest. It was
a brave defence! It was a long, protracted, painful struggle!
But it was in vain. At length, the batteries of the
enemy had reached within eighty yards of the American
defences, and preparations were making for a general
storm. Thus environed by a formidable force, both by
sea and land,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">----"Nec spes opis ulla dabatur"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>it was the dictate of humanity, both in respect to the inhabitants
of the city, and the brave, but exhausted, remnant
of his devoted army, to capitulate. Accordingly, overtures
were made to General Clinton, which were at length
accepted. Charleston fell, and the entire army laid down
arms. By the terms of capitulation, the garrison were to
march out, and deposit their arms in front of the works;
but, as a mark of humiliation, the drums were not to beat
an American march, nor their colors to be displayed. This
was severe; but the humiliation was remembered, when,
eighteen months afterwards, Lord Cornwallis surrendered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
at Yorktown, and "waters of a full cup were wrung out"
to him.</p>



<h4>3. BATTLE OF CAMDEN.</h4>


<p>The fall of Charleston opened the south to Cornwallis,
nor was he slow to take advantage of the opportunity of
strengthening the royal cause. Baron de Kalb had been
sent from the main army to the assistance of Lincoln; but
the latter having surrendered before his arrival, the former
assumed the command of the forces opposed to Cornwallis.
Shortly after, however, Gates, the "hero of Saratoga,"
arrived, having been appointed to occupy the place of
General Lincoln.</p>

<p>The reputation which Gates had acquired in his contest
with Burgoyne, had preceded him, and served to stay the
despondency and gloom which was extensively pervading
the South. The militia responded to his call, and came
flocking to his standard. Thus rëinforced, he proceeded
towards Camden, the rendezvous of Lord Rawdon. But
his haste was ill-judged. Besides, by reason of a serious
lack of provisions for his troops, which he had neglected to
provide, they were compelled to subsist for several days on
green apples, corn, and other vegetables; their strength,
also, was still more diminished for want of needful rest. On
reaching the vicinity of Rawdon, instead of an immediate
attack, before the latter could receive rëinforcements, and
when he was more on an equal footing with the enemy, he
wasted several days in skirmishes, which served to darken
rather than brighten his chance of success. In this interval,
Cornwallis arrived with the troops under his command, thus
adding to the strength of the enemy, and greatly increasing
their confidence and courage.</p>

<p>Indeed, Cornwallis was not slow in deciding to hazard an
engagement, although he knew that the contest would still
be unequal. Gates had superior numbers. But a retreat
would be to abandon all that he had gained in South Carolina
and Georgia; and in effect would be the ruin of the
royal cause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span></p>

<p>The American army occupied a post at Rugely's mills.
On the 11th of August, at ten o'clock in the night, the
English began their march. Ignorant of this movement,
Gates had put his army in motion at the same time, and
with similar intent. What was their mutual surprise, when
at two o'clock in the morning, the advanced-guard of the
British suddenly came in contact with the head column of
the Americans! A brief skirmish ensued&mdash;but soon ended,
as if by mutual consent&mdash;neither commander being willing
to hazard a nocturnal rencounter.</p>

<p>At a council of war summoned by Gates, the Baron de
Kalb advised a retreat to their former encampment, as in
their present position they were between two marshes,
while at Rugely's mills they would have the decided advantage
as to position. In this, however, he was overruled by
Gates, who decided to wait the approach of the enemy
where they were.</p>

<p>We shall not enter into the details of this unfortunate
battle. It was sad and sanguinary. General Gates misjudged
as to position; but still greater was his error in
attempting to change the order of battle almost at the
moment when the battle began. Of this latter mistake,
Cornwallis was not slow to take advantage, but at once
ordered his troops to charge. Unprepared for an attack
so sudden and so furious, the American column gave way&mdash;the
Virginians actually betaking themselves to flight. All
was soon confusion and uproar. De Kalb threw himself at
the head of the regular troops, and, infusing into them the
fire and indignation which animated his own bosom, led them
on. They advanced firm&mdash;calm&mdash;determined. But the
contest was now unequal. They could not resist the
impetuous torrent which came thundering upon them.
They could not save the battle. And at this time&mdash;their
ranks thinned&mdash;their path obstructed&mdash;the cavalry of Tarleton
came bearing down upon them with the impetuosity of
a whirlwind. "Shot after shot had struck the Baron de
Kalb, and the blood was pouring from his side in streams;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
yet, animated by that spirit which has made the hero in
every age, he rallied his men for a last charge, and led them
at the point of the bayonet on the dense ranks. Striking a
bayonet from his breast, and laying the grenadier that held
it dead at his feet, he pressed forward, and, in the very
act of cheering on his men, fell with the blood gushing
from eleven wounds. His aids immediately covered him
with their bodies, exclaiming, 'Save the Baron de Kalb!
save the Baron de Kalb!'"</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="illus-428.jpg" id="illus-428.jpg"></a>
   <img src="images/illus-428.jpg" alt="Death of De Kalb." title="Death of De Kalb."/>
   <p class="caption2">Death of De Kalb.</p>
</div>

<p>But their efforts to save him were unavailing. He was
taken prisoner, and his troops fled. Gates, meanwhile, was
pursuing his fugitive army. Their arrest and recall were,
however, beyond his power. The rout was entire; the
defeat complete; owing, as was thought by men of competent
judgment, to the mismanagement of Gates.</p>

<p>De Kalb survived his wounds but a short time. He was
able, however, to dictate a brief letter to the patriotic band
of soldiers at whose head he had planted himself, and who
nobly sustained him up to the moment of his fall. He died<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
in the cause of liberty&mdash;regretted by all who knew his worth
as a man and a soldier&mdash;and honored by congress, which
directed a monument to be erected to his memory at
Annapolis.</p>

<p>The battle at Camden was sanguinary, and had the effect
to spread a gloom over the face of American affairs. The
loss of the patriots exceeded six hundred in killed; the
wounded and prisoners thirteen hundred. The British
stated their loss to be only three hundred in killed and
wounded.</p>

<p>Cornwallis was the victor&mdash;but the British cause had now
reached its culminating point. Elated at their successes,
the conquerors grew insolent and rapacious; the Americans,
resolute and determined.</p>



<h4>4. BATTLE OF COWPENS.</h4>


<p>Never did a service require an able and efficient commander
more than the American service at the South,
following the disastrous defeat of Gates at the battle of
Camden. Fortunately, the precise man was found in General
Greene, "who, next to Washington, was the ablest
commander in the Revolutionary army"&mdash;an officer of large
experience, and distinguished for two qualities, which were
more important, at this juncture, than all others&mdash;"great
caution and great rapidity." To these were added a wonderful
fortitude and as wonderful perseverance.</p>

<p>On assuming the command, Greene found the army
reduced to two thousand men, of whom not more than
eight hundred were fit for service. The officers, however,
had few equals&mdash;and no superiors. There were Morgan,
Lee, Marion, Sumpter, and Washington (Lieutenant-colonel),
men, whose heroic achievements have justly placed
them high on the rolls of military fame. Had the army
borne any comparison to its officers, either in point of numbers
or in discipline, energy, and enthusiasm, the royal
cause, in the South, would have met a still earlier doom than
it did. But the army was not only greatly reduced in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
numbers, but so destitute was it of arms, ammunition, food,
and clothing, that it seemed a matter of presumption to
attempt entering the list with Cornwallis, who, to a well-disciplined
and powerful army, added every desirable
materiel of war. But it often occurred during the Revolutionary
struggle, that "the race was not to the swift, nor
the battle to the strong."</p>

<p>The first measure adopted by Greene was unusual&mdash;he
separated his forces, small as they were, into several divisions,
and stationed them at different points. For this he
has been censured, as contrary to military rule; but the
sequel proved the wisdom of the measure. It served
greatly to dismay Cornwallis, who scarcely knew in what
direction to proceed, or which one to attack&mdash;whether
Morgan, Marion, or Lee, who, with their respective
detachments, were threatening him from different points.</p>

<p>At length, however, he decided to begin with Morgan,
who was stationed at Cowpens, with an available force of
less than a thousand men. The plan proposed by Cornwallis
was, that Tarleton, with eleven hundred men, should
assail him in front, while he himself, with the main army,
would attempt to prevent his retreat. On the appearance
of Tarleton, Morgan retired; but being, at length, hotly
pressed, a contest became inevitable. The first onset of
Tarleton was terrible&mdash;the Americans gave way, and the
victorious British were anticipating the utter rout of their
foes. But, at a critical moment of the action, Colonel
Washington, who had been watching the various movements
of the respective armies, gave orders to his bugler to
sound a charge. It was nobly done! Nothing could withstand
the impetuosity, the fire, the fury of the assailants.
The infantry, which was pressing on to victory, were, as
in a moment, borne down, and scattered like chaff before
the whirlwind. Morgan had time to rally his repulsed
force; and, with such an example as had been set them,
they now sped their way to victory. It was a brief, but a
stirring, sanguinary scene. Tarleton lost of his eleven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
hundred, seven hundred&mdash;besides two cannon, eight hundred
muskets, and a hundred dragoons.</p>

   <img src="images/illus-431.jpg" alt="Charge of Colonel Washington." title="Charge of Colonel Washington."/>
   <p class="caption2">Charge of Colonel Washington.</p>
</div>

<p>The battle over, Morgan hastily retired, in order to
escape Cornwallis, who was bearing down upon him. In
this he was successful; but it was only at the sacrifice of
the baggage, and a large part of the stores of the army.
Cornwallis pursued a similar policy&mdash;never was man more
determined to make sure of the enemy than he was; and
never was man more determined to escape than Morgan.
His object was to reach the head-quarters of Greene; but,
at the distance of fifty miles, it was his good fortune to
meet his general, who, with a small force, was hastening
to his assistance.</p>



<h4>5. RETREAT&mdash;SUBSEQUENT MOVEMENTS.</h4>


<p>Immediately following the battle of Cowpens, Greene
directed his course towards Guilford, which he had appointed
as the rendezvous of his army. This was a perilous
undertaking; and the more so, as his route lay across the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
Catawba, the Yadkin, and the Dan&mdash;each of which was
liable to be suddenly swelled, and thus prevent his passage;
and at a time, perhaps, when Cornwallis would be pressing
upon him. Besides, the winter was a most unpropitious
season for such an enterprise. The soldiers were poorly
clad; many of them were barefoot; blankets were greatly
needed, and even provisions were scarce. But there was
no safe alternative. Greene's force was inadequate to maintain
a position against so formidable a force as Cornwallis
had under his command. It was not indeed certain that a
retreat so distant, and so fraught with difficulties, could be
effected in safety. But it was decided to run the hazard,
and towards the accomplishment of his plans, Greene now
put forth all his energy and skill.</p>

<p>We shall not follow him minutely in the various steps of
his remarkable and successful enterprise. Often did the
English advance columns press upon his rear; and so determined
were the former&mdash;with such rapidity did they urge
their pursuit&mdash;that the fugitives were able in some instances
to rest but three hours out of the twenty-four, and to secure
but one meal a-day. Their fatigue&mdash;their deprivations&mdash;their
sufferings, penetrated the very heart of their sympathizing
leader. His own anxiety was deep and wasting;
yet he had a smile and a word of encouragement as he
rode up, and hurried forward his exhausted columns.</p>

<p>At length they approached the Dan; that passed, they
were safe; but this was the point of their greatest danger.
Cornwallis was near at hand, and, like Pharaoh of old,
pressing upon the children of Israel at the banks of the Red
sea, was confident of their utter extermination&mdash;he had
resolved to overwhelm and annihilate the American army
on the banks of the Dan.</p>

<p>They reached those banks. In the rear, covering their
embarkation, and, if possible, keeping in check the advance
of the now infuriated enemy, were stationed Lee's legion
and Washington's horsemen. It was a noble but perilous
enterprise which they had undertaken. Had the forces of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
Cornwallis reached them, it is impossible to conjecture the
issue. They had decided to succeed or perish.</p>

<p>But about noon, a messenger made his appearance upon
a swift charger, making the joyful announcement that the
army had safely made the passage. The guard now themselves
urged their way to the ferry. Greene had not yet
crossed. He had delayed through his anxiety for the safety
of Lee and Washington, and their brave comrades. Who
can describe his exultation as they came dashing on their
proud steeds! That was a moment of intense joy; but that
joy reached its climax when all were safely on the opposite
shore, and the deep waters of the Dan were rolling between
his army and their pursuers. The last boat that left, bore the
intrepid Lee, and, as it grounded upon the opposite shore,
the British van had reached the banks. This was the
climax of their disappointment. At the end of a pursuit of
two hundred and fifty miles, and during which they had
destroyed all their baggage to accelerate their progress, it
was their destiny to behold their prey exulting beyond their
reach. Of this retreat, it has been well remarked, that "for
the skill with which it was planned, the resolution and energy
with which it was carried through, and the distance traveled,
it stands alone in the annals of our country, and will bear a
comparison with the most renowned feats of ancient or
modern times. It covered Greene with more glory than a
victory could have done, and stamped him at once the great
commander."</p>

<p>Soon after the events now recited, the army of General
Greene was augmented by the arrival of rëinforcements
from Virginia, to five thousand five hundred men. Numerically,
his force was larger than that of Cornwallis, but most
of the troops were for the first time in a camp. Thus
strengthened, Greene decided to hazard an engagement as
early as circumstances allowed. With this object in view,
after giving his troops some little opportunity to rest, he
proceeded, and took post at Guilford.</p>

<p>Here, on the 15th of March, occurred the battle of <i>Guilford<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>
Court-house</i>, which on the part of Greene had been so
wisely planned as must have issued in the utter discomfiture
of Cornwallis, had all the Americans behaved with their
accustomed bravery. But, most unfortunately, the terrible
aspect of the British army, on its near approach, spread
consternation and dismay among the Carolina militia; and,
throwing down their guns, knapsacks, and canteens, they
precipitately left the scene of action. These were followed
by a portion of the Marylanders. It was impossible to rally
them, or even to stay their progress. But the Virginians
fought nobly, as did the second regiment of the Marylanders.
Upon these and the continental troops, the entire force of
the battle fell. For a time, even with the loss of the aid of
those who so ignobly fled, victory seemed to decide for the
Americans. But at length Cornwallis, at a great sacrifice
of men, succeeded in getting the ascendancy, and no alternative
was left to Greene but to order a retreat, while it
could safely be made. The loss of the Americans was
about four hundred, in killed and wounded; that of the
British reached nearly six hundred. The British claimed
the victory, but it was a victory which caused Fox to
exclaim, when announced in the British House of Commons,
"<i>Another such will ruin the British army.</i>"</p>

<p>Following the battle above described, Cornwallis retreated
to such a distance from Greene, as to present little inducement
to the latter to follow, even had his force been able to
cope with that under his lordship's command. It remained,
therefore, for him to adopt some new plan, and to look in
another direction for some field of usefulness to his country's
cause. After much consideration, he decided to lead back
his forces into South Carolina, and to fall on the line of the
British posts between Ninety-Six and Charleston. It was
a bold, original, and hazardous experiment; and the more
so, as Cornwallis <i>might</i> also return, and press him with his
superior force. But the decision was made; and, taking up
his line of march, in twelve days he reached Camden, where
Lord Rawdon was strongly intrenched.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span></p>

<p>Taking a position on Hobkirk's hill, two miles north of
Camden, Rawdon in a few days drew out his forces, and
appeared in battle array against him. At the time the
approach of the enemy was announced, the Americans were
deeply engaged in cooking food, of which, for twenty-four
hours, they had been destitute. For a moment, there was
confusion; but, abandoning their meal, as did Greene his
coffee, they soon stood in order of battle. The action
opened with promise to the Americans. Greene himself, at
the head of a single regiment, fought as a common soldier.
His troops appeared firm, and even enthusiastic. Judge
his surprise, when, at this critical moment, he perceived the
regiment of Gunby, the one upon which, more perhaps than
all others, he depended&mdash;the one which at Guilford had displayed
such bravery&mdash;that regiment was giving way&mdash;was
in the very act of retreating. Greene sped his charger
among them&mdash;headed them&mdash;rallied them; but it was too
late: the battle was lost. There was, indeed, more fighting,
and every effort was made to recover from the shock caused
by the retreat of Gunby's veteran regiment. But it was
fruitless, and Greene retreated, in rather a creditable manner,
considering the circumstances.</p>

<p>But the regiment, it is recorded&mdash;the cause of such deep
mortification and utter failure&mdash;was after all not to blame.
At least, the apology was made for them, that they mistook
the order of Gunby, their leader, who had directed them
only to halt, for an order to retreat. In the din of arms,
his command was not understood, and the consequence was
the disastrous result we have named.</p>

<p>The situation of Rawdon, notwithstanding his success,
was critical; Greene's was still more critical. For the first
time, it is said, the latter became vacillating and despondent.
On the one hand, he was in danger from Rawdon; and on
the other, it was reported that Cornwallis was marching
rapidly against him. His army was small&mdash;destitute&mdash;discouraged.
But it was not Greene's nature long to despond.
He rose above the difficulties and perils of his position, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>
decided to occupy the place which God and his country had
assigned him.</p>

<p>At this juncture, more certain intelligence was received
that Cornwallis was on his march to Virginia. This left him
at liberty to follow out his original plan.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Rawdon broke up his encampment at Camden,
and moved towards Fort Motte, against which Marion and
Lee were pursuing a siege. Before Rawdon could reach
it, it had surrendered to the Americans.</p>

<p>There remained now in the hands of the British but one
fortress more of importance. This was Ninety-Six, situated
one hundred and forty-seven miles north-west from Charleston,
and garrisoned by five hundred and sixty men. To
the reduction of this, Greene turned his attention. On the
22d of May, he appeared before it, and commenced a siege.
While successfully pursuing his design, and daily advancing
towards the consummation of his wishes, news arrived of
the rapid approach of Rawdon. Indeed, he appeared even
earlier than had been anticipated, and Greene had no alternative
but to retreat. But, listening to his army, who were
intent on a demonstration against the enemy, he consented
thereto: but, although they made the assault with admirable
firmness, and even enthusiastic zeal, they failed, and orders
to retreat were given.</p>

<p>Rawdon followed Greene some fifteen or twenty miles on
his retreat; when, returning to Ninety-Six, he ordered its
evacuation, and himself took up his march for Charleston.</p>

<p>As the sickly season had now commenced, Greene withdrew
his army to a cool and salubrious position on the high
hills of Santee. Here, having remained until the 22d of
August&mdash;his troops resting and recruiting, as much they
needed both&mdash;he broke up his encampment, and began his
march; and on the 7th of September, arrived within seven
miles of Eutaw Springs, where the British lay encamped in
an open field, under command of General Stewart.</p>

<p>On the following day, putting his army in motion, he
proceeded towards the field, where occurred&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span></p>



<h4>6. THE BATTLE OF EUTAW SPRINGS.</h4>


<p>Greene took the British commander somewhat by surprise,
but he was not slow to put his army in the order of battle.
The Americans were the first to commence the contest, and
that commencement was auspicious. The militia did themselves
greater credit than on some former occasions. Both
armies were soon engaged; both contended with a seriousness,
a determination, a perseverance, commensurate with
the prize at stake. It is not necessary to descend to particulars.
Each cause was apparently more than once in
the ascendant, but in the sequel neither could claim a decided
victory. Yet, the advantage rested with Greene. The
English had lost one-quarter of their number in killed, and
another quarter were made prisoners. Moreover, he had
driven them from the field; but he could not pursue them,
on account of his prisoners and wounded, and the exhausted
state of his army.</p>

<p>At the close of the contest, the belligerent armies united
in burying their dead. What a contrast to the spectacle
which had been exhibited a few hours before!</p>

<p>The battle of Eutaw Springs was the last general engagement
in the South. Soon after, the British concentrated
themselves at Charleston; and here they were for months
hemmed in, and watched by the faithful and persevering
Greene. But their situation, at length, became so distressing,
that they determined to evacuate the city. This was
carried into effect on the 13th of December, 1781. At three
o'clock of the same day, Greene entered in triumph, to the
exultation of its emancipated citizens, and with all the honors
which a grateful people could shed upon him. "<i>God bless
you! God bless you!</i>" was uttered by hundreds, as he passed
along; nor was it a thoughtless, unmeaning prayer, but the
warm and ardent desire of warm and ardent hearts. Greene
merited it all: he loved his country with an affection which
no circumstances could weaken, and served her with a
fidelity which no temptation could interrupt. Truthfully,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>
most truthfully, did Washington say of him: "Could he but
promote the interests of his country in the character of a
corporal, he would exchange, without a murmur, his epaulettes
for the knot."</p>



<h4>7. BATTLE OF YORKTOWN.</h4>


<p>The campaign for the year 1781, as arranged between
Washington and the Count de Rochambeau at Wethersfield,
Connecticut, had for its object the recovery of New York,
still in possession of the British. A French fleet, to arrive
in August, was expected to cöoperate. In pursuance of this
plan, the allied forces were concentrated at Kingsbridge,
fifteen miles above New York.</p>

<p>While these movements were in progress, it was unexpectedly
announced that the destination of the French fleet
was the Chesapeake, instead of New York; and here the
Count de Grasse, at length, arrived with twenty-eight ships
of the line, several frigates, and three thousand troops.</p>

<p>This intelligence manifested the necessity of a change of
purpose. Without the cöoperation of a fleet, it would be
impossible to succeed in the reduction of New York. Besides,
there now opened an equally, if not a more important
enterprise, in a different quarter.</p>

<p>Lord Cornwallis, who had for some time conducted the
military operations of the British at the South, as we have
had occasion to notice, had concentrated his forces at Yorktown,
in Virginia, which, together with Gloucester Point,
he had strongly fortified. His army consisted of ten thousand
effective men.</p>

<p>Washington was not long in deciding the course which
the interests of his country required him to pursue. He
was now ready to follow the indications of Providence:
and it was now apparent that a victory over Cornwallis
must necessarily forward the triumph of the patriot cause.
It was happily ordered that the French fleet should have
the Chesapeake for its destination. In that vicinity, the
final conflict was to be waged; there, the pride of Britain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>
was to be humbled; there, the last act in the drama was to
transpire.</p>

<p>Pursuant to his altered purposes, Washington put his army
in motion, and on the 25th of August, the passage of the
Hudson was effected.</p>

<p>It being a point of great moment to conceal the real object
of this movement, the march of the army was continued until
the 31st, in such a direction as to keep up fears for New
York; and a considerable degree of address was used to
countenance the opinion that the real design was against
that place. The letters which had been intercepted by Sir
Henry Clinton favored this deception; and so strong was
the impression made, that after it became necessary for the
combined army to leave the route leading down the Hudson,
he is stated to have retained his fears for New York, and
not to have suspected the real object of his adversary, until
he had approached the Delaware, and it had become too
late to obstruct the progress of the allied army towards
Virginia. He then resolved to make every exertion in his
power to relieve Lord Cornwallis, and, in the mean time, to
act offensively in the North. An expedition was planned
against New London, in Connecticut; and a strong detachment,
under the command of General Arnold, was embarked
on board a fleet of transports, which landed early in the
morning of the 6th of September on both sides of the harbor,
about three miles from the town. The result of this
expedition&mdash;so infamous to Arnold&mdash;so inhuman&mdash;so contrary
to all the laws governing modern warfare&mdash;is too well
known to need recital here.</p>

<p>The progress of Washington could not consistently be
arrested by such an incursion, ready, as in other circumstances
he would have been, to have hastened to the defence
of his fellow-citizens, against so vindictive a monster as that
traitor had shown himself to be. Momentous results were
now depending upon accelerated movements; and, accordingly,
he urged his troops forward to the extent of their
power.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span></p>

<p>Having made the necessary arrangements for the conveyance
of his army down the Chesapeake, Washington,
accompanied by several distinguished officers, French and
American, hastened forward to Williamsburg, where, in an
interview with the Count de Grasse, a system of operations
for the contemplated siege was devised.</p>

<p>On the 25th of September, the last division of the allied
troops arrived in James' river, and were disembarked at the
landing near Williamsburg. On the 30th, the combined
armies, twelve thousand in number, moved upon Yorktown
and Gloucester, at which time the fleet of Count de Grasse
proceeded up York river, with the double object of preventing
the retreat of Cornwallis, and intercepting his supplies.</p>

<p>The village of Yorktown lies on the south side of York
river. Its southern banks are high. In its waters a ship-of-the-line
could ride with safety. Gloucester Point projects
far into the river on the opposite shore. Both these posts
were occupied by Cornwallis&mdash;the main body of the army
being at York, under the immediate command of his lordship;
Lieutenant-colonel Tarleton was stationed at Gloucester
with a detachment of about six hundred men. Every
possible effort had been made to fortify these posts. The
interests involved were of incalculable magnitude. A failure
now, Cornwallis could not but perceive, would put to
hazard the royal cause. Every expedient, therefore, was
adopted, which was calculated to secure his success, and
give victory to the British arms.</p>

<p>Washington was equally impressed with the greatness of
the enterprise in which he had embarked. The eyes of his
countrymen were turned with intense interest to the issues
of the impending contest. Nor can it be doubted that supplications
went up from thousands of family altars, and from
private closets, that the God of the Pilgrim Fathers would
interpose for the salvation of a people, who, from their first
landing on these shores, had regarded his honor as their
highest object, and the enjoyment of rational liberty as their
greatest privilege.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span></p>

<p>The preparations having now been completed, Yorktown
was invested, upon which Cornwallis, abandoning all his
advanced works, retired behind his principal fortifications.
The former were immediately occupied by the besiegers.</p>

<p>It is not important to detail the events of each succeeding
day, as this siege progressed. Washington, calm and collected,
continued to extend his batteries towards the principal
works of the enemy. The cannonade from the British
line of defences was furious and incessant. On the 16th, a
fierce sortie was made by the British, an American battery
was stormed&mdash;the artillerists were overpowered, and seven
cannon spiked; but the Americans rallied, and succeeded
in recovering all that was lost.</p>

<p>Finding his situation extremely critical, Cornwallis now
decided on abandoning his sick, together with his baggage,
and, crossing to Gloucester, to attempt an escape to New
York. In pursuance of this plan, boats, prepared under
various pretexts, were held in readiness to receive the
troops at ten in the evening, and convey them over the
river. The arrangements were made with such secresy, that
the first embarkation arrived at the Point unperceived, and
part of the troops were landed, when a sudden and violent
storm interrupted the execution of this hazardous plan, and
drove the boats down the river. The storm continued till
near daylight, when the boats returned. But the plan was
necessarily abandoned, and the boats were sent to bring
back the soldiers, who were rëlanded on the southern shore
in the course of the forenoon without much loss.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 17th, several new batteries which
had been completed were opened, and a more appalling,
and, if possible, destructive fire, was commenced upon the
British works. It could no longer be withstood. Cornwallis
became convinced of the folly of protracting a contest
which was only weakening his forces, and sacrificing the
lives of his troops. It was a most unwelcome and humiliating
necessity, but that necessity existed, and at ten o'clock
he ordered the British lines to beat a parley. This was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>
immediately followed by a proposed cessation of hostilities for
twenty-four hours, with reference to a settlement of terms of
capitulation. Washington, in his reply, expressed his desire
to stay the effusion of blood, but not one moment could he
lose in fruitless negotiations. His lordship might transmit his
proposals, and two hours would be given to consider them.
These were transmitted, but they proved unsatisfactory.
Washington now himself dictated the terms; and they were
the same as given to Lincoln at the fall of Charleston. At
the appointed time, the conquered army, with colors cased,
and drums silent, marched out, and laid down their arms.
Lincoln was appointed to receive the sword of Cornwallis&mdash;an
honor which he deserved&mdash;and a service doubtless the
more grateful from the circumstance that, eighteen months
before, he had been compelled to surrender his sword to an
English commander. It was an imposing spectacle. To
the British, the more humiliating, as it cast a shade over all
their prospects of success in the land of rebellion&mdash;to the
Americans, the more grateful, as it was a presage of an end
to their toils and hardships. The conduct of Cornwallis, on
the occasion of surrender, was unbecoming the firm and
high-minded officer. He was not present, but appointed
another to tender his sword in his place. There are men
who can participate in the honors of victory, and claim
their full portion&mdash;but who are too proud to share with
their fellow-officers and soldiers the mortification of defeat.
Cornwallis was one.</p>

<p>To Washington and his army the issue of this contest was
most joyful; and in token of that joy, orders were issued
that all under arrest, should forthwith be set at liberty. But
this was not enough. A public recognition of the Divine
goodness seemed befitting; accordingly, in his public orders,
in terms most solemn and impressive, he directed that divine
service should be performed in the different brigades and
divisions. All the troops not on duty were recommended
to be present, and to assist in the solemn and grateful
homage paid to the Benefactor of the nation.</p>

<h4>8. TREATY OF PEACE.</h4>


<p>The first intelligence received in America from England,
after the news of the battle of Yorktown had reached that
country, was different in its tenor from what had been
expected. The Americans regarded it as the finishing
stroke of the war, and anticipated a similar estimation of
the battle in England. But on the assembling of parliament
in November, 1781, the speech from the throne
breathed a settled purpose to continue the war; and the
addresses from both houses, which were carried by large
majorities, echoed the sentiment.</p>

<p>But when the first excitement had passed, and men began
to contemplate the posture of things with calm and enlightened
reason, they saw the folly of persisting in the contest.
To conquer America by force, was impracticable, and the
further waste of treasure and blood, was both impolitic
and inhuman.</p>

<p>Pursuant to these corrected views, on the 22d of February,
1782, General Conway moved an address to the king,
praying that the war on the continent of North America
might no longer be pursued, for the impracticable purpose
of reducing that country to obedience by force; and expressing
their hope, that the earnest desire and diligent exertion
to restore the public tranquillity, of which they had received
his majesty's most gracious assurances, might, by a happy
reconciliation with the revolted colonies, be forwarded and
made effectual; to which great end his majesty's faithful
Commons would be ready to give their utmost assistance.
This motion being lost by a single vote only, was, five days
after, renewed by the same gentleman, in a form somewhat
different, and was carried; and an address, in pursuance of
it, presented to the king. Not yet satisfied with the triumph
obtained over the ministry, and considering the answer of
the king not sufficiently explicit, the House of Commons,
on the 4th of March, on the motion of General Conway,
declared, that all those who should advise, or by any means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>
attempt, the further prosecution of offensive war in America,
should be considered as enemies to their king and country.
In this state of things, it was impossible for the ministry
longer to continue in power, and on the 19th, they relinquished
their places. A new administration was soon after
formed&mdash;the Marquis of Rockingham was placed at the
head of the treasury, and the Earl of Shelburne and Mr.
Fox held the important places of secretaries.</p>

<p>Measures were immediately adopted by the new ministry
with a view to peace. As the basis of peace, it was the
wish of the Marquis of Rockingham to offer America unlimited,
unconditional independence. To this, the Earl of
Shelburne was opposed; and, moreover, it was one of the
last measures to which the king himself would give his
assent. In July, the Marquis of Rockingham died, and
Lord Shelburne was appointed first lord of the treasury.
This produced an open rupture in the cabinet, and the
resignation of Lord John Cavendish, Mr. Fox, and others;
in consequence of which, William Pitt was made chancellor
of the exchequer, and Thomas Townshend and Lord Grantham,
secretaries of state. On the 11th of July, parliament
adjourned. Among their last acts, was one authorizing the
king to conclude a peace or truce with the Americans.</p>

<p>On the 30th of November, 1782, a provisional treaty was
agreed on at Paris, by John Adams, Benjamin Franklin,
John Jay, and Henry Laurens, on the part of America, and
by Mr. Fitzherbert and Mr. Oswald, on the part of Great
Britain.</p>

<p>It may be added, in this connection, that the definitive
treaty of peace was signed at Paris, on the 3d of September,
by David Hartley, Esq., on the part of his Britannic majesty,
and by John Jay, Benjamin Franklin, and John Adams, on
the part of the United States. The provisions of the treaty
attest the zeal and ability of the American negotiation, as
well as the liberal feelings which actuated the British
minority. The independence of the United States was fully
acknowledged. The right of fishing on the banks of Newfoundland,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
and certain facilities in the enjoyment of that
right, were secured to them for ever.</p>



<h4>9. CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES.</h4>


<p>On the 18th of April, 1783, Gen. Washington announced
the cessation of hostilities between the two countries, in the
following general order:</p>

<p>"The commander-in-chief orders the cessation of hostilities
between the United States of America and the King
of Great Britain, to be publicly proclaimed to-morrow, at
twelve o'clock, at the New Building; and the proclamation,
which will be communicated herewith, be read to-morrow
evening, at the head of every regiment and corps of the
army; after which, the chaplains, with the several brigades,
will render thanks to Almighty God for all his mercies,
particularly for his overruling the wrath of man to his own
glory, and causing the rage of war to cease among the
nations."&mdash;It is worthy of notice that this order was read to
the army just eight years after the battle of Lexington.</p>



<h4>10. THE ARMY DISBANDED.</h4>


<p>On the 2d of November, Washington issued his farewell
orders to the army. In conclusion, he said:</p>

<p>"Being now to conclude these his last public orders, to
take his ultimate leave, in a short time, of the military character,
and to bid adieu to the armies he has so long had the
honor to command, he can only again offer in their behalf
his recommendations to their grateful country, and his
prayers to the God of armies. May ample justice be done
them here, and may the choicest of Heaven's favors, both
here and hereafter, attend those who, under the Divine
auspices, have secured innumerable blessings for others!
With these wishes, and this benediction, the commander-in-chief
is about to retire from service. The curtain of separation
will soon be drawn, and the military scene to him
will be for ever closed."</p>

<p>What more tender!&mdash;what more touching! While to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>
Washington himself, and to his army, it must have been
most grateful that years of toil, privation, and suffering
were ended, and the glorious object for which that toil,
privation, and suffering had been endured, was achieved,
the hour of separation must have been most painful. They
were to part to meet no more. Well did his soldiers know
that their brave and beloved chief would bear them in his
heart. But there were circumstances which, at this final
interview, bore heavily upon them. They were poor; and,
in rags and destitution, they were returning to their homes.
Washington's sympathies were enlisted for them; and while
he could not justify the course they had pursued&mdash;for they
had passed resolutions in their encampment reflecting on
the justice of their country, and especially upon congress,
and had used terms of harshness and threatening&mdash;yet
Washington expressed his pity, and his ardent hope that
ample justice would be done them by a grateful country
for the services they had rendered, and for the toils and
trials they had sustained.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span></p>

<p>The parting moment now arrived. Column after column
marched by him, receiving as they passed his tender and
affectionate salutation&mdash;the several bands of music playing
the mournful, yet, on this parting occasion, appropriate
dirge of "Roslin Castle."</p>



<h4>11. DEPARTURE OF THE BRITISH ARMY.</h4>


<p>The 25th of November had been fixed for the final retirement
from the American shores of the British officers and
troops. The place of departure was New York; and on
that day they went on board the British fleet&mdash;the American
troops, under General Knox, at the same time entering and
taking possession of the city.</p>

<p>Guards being posted for the security of the citizens, General
Washington, accompanied by Governor Clinton, and
attended by many civil and military officers, and a large
number of respectable inhabitants on horseback, made his
public entry into the city. What a triumph! What a glorious
issue of the toils, anxieties, and hardships, growing
out of an eight years' contest! It was an occasion of joy,
such as the sun had not beamed upon since the day he was
lighted up in the firmament. Public dinners followed, and
magnificent fireworks attested the general joy.</p>



<h4>12. FINAL INTERVIEW OF WASHINGTON AND HIS OFFICERS.</h4>


<p>One other painful, yet pleasing scene, awaited the commander-in-chief&mdash;the
parting with the officers of the army,
the companions of his toils and triumph. The affecting
interview took place on the 4th of December. "At noon,
the principal officers of the army assembled at Francis's
tavern; soon after which, their beloved commander entered
the room. His emotions were too strong to be concealed.
Filling a glass, he turned to them, and said: 'With a heart
full of love and gratitude, I now take leave of you; I most
devoutly wish that your latter days may be as prosperous
and happy, as your former ones have been glorious and
honorable.' Having drunk, he added: 'I cannot come to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>
each of you to take my leave, but shall be obliged if each
of you will come and take me by the hand.' General Knox,
being nearest, turned to him. Washington, incapable of
utterance, grasped his hand, and embraced him. In the
same affectionate manner, he took leave of each succeeding
officer. The tear of manly sensibility was in every eye;
and not a word was articulated to interrupt the dignified
silence and the tenderness of the scene. Leaving the room,
he passed through the corps of light infantry, and walked to
Whitehall, where a barge waited to convey him to Powles'
Hook. The whole company followed in mute and solemn
procession, with dejected countenances, testifying feelings
of delicious melancholy, which no language can describe.
Having entered the barge, he turned to the company, and,
waving his hat, bade them a silent adieu. They paid him
the same affectionate compliment; and after the barge had
left them, returned in the same solemn manner to the place
where they had assembled."</p>

<h4>13. WASHINGTON RESIGNS HIS COMMISSION.</h4>


<p>And there was still one further duty obligatory upon
Washington&mdash;one act more, and his earthly glory was consummated&mdash;to
give back the commission which for eight
years he had held, and which, had he been actuated by the
ambition of Alexander, Cæsar, or Napoleon, he might have
employed to ascend a throne. To the fulfillment of this last
and highest duty he now addressed himself. Leaving New
York, he repaired to Annapolis, in Maryland, where congress
was in session, and, on the 20th of December, informed
that body of his intention, and requested a day to be assigned
for the performance of the duty.</p>

<p>"To give the more dignity to the act, they determined
that it should be offered at a public audience on the following
Tuesday at twelve o'clock.</p>

<p>"When the hour arrived for performing a ceremony so
well calculated to recall the various interesting scenes which
had passed, since the commission now to be returned was
granted, the gallery was crowded with spectators, and
several persons of distinction were admitted on the floor of
congress. The members remained seated and covered.
The spectators were standing and uncovered. The general
was introduced by the secretary, and conducted to a
chair. After a short pause, the president informed him that
'The United States, in congress assembled, were prepared
to receive his communications.' With native dignity,
improved by the solemnity of the occasion, the general
rose, and delivered the following address:</p>

<p>"'<i>Mr. President</i>: The great events on which my resignation
depended, having at length taken place, I have now the
honor of offering my sincere congratulations to congress,
and of presenting myself before them, to surrender into
their hands the trust committed to me, and to claim the
indulgence of retiring from the service of my country.</p>

<p>"'Happy in the confirmation of our independence and
sovereignty, and pleased with the opportunity afforded the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span>
United States of becoming a respectable nation, I resign
with satisfaction the appointment I accepted with diffidence;
a diffidence in my abilities to accomplish so arduous a task,
which, however, was superseded by a confidence in the
rectitude of our cause, the support of the supreme power
of the union, and the patronage of Heaven.</p>

<p>"'The successful termination of the war, has verified the
most sanguine expectations; and my gratitude for the interposition
of Providence, and the assistance I have received
from my countrymen, increases with every review of the
momentous contest.</p>

<p>"'While I repeat my obligations to the army in general, I
should do injustice to my own feelings not to acknowledge,
in this place, the peculiar services and distinguished merits
of the gentlemen who have been attached to my person
during the war. It was impossible that the choice of confidential
officers to compose my family, should have been
more fortunate. Permit me, sir, to recommend, in particular,
those who have continued in the service to the present
moment, as worthy of the favorable notice and patronage
of congress.</p>

<p>"'I consider it an indispensable duty to close this last act
of my official life, by commending the interests of our dearest
country to the protection of Almighty God, and those who
have the superintendence of them to his holy keeping.</p>

<p>"'Having now finished the work assigned me, I retire from
the great theatre of action, and, bidding an affectionate farewell
to this august body, under whose orders I have so long
acted, I here offer my commission, and take my leave of all
the employments of public life.'"</p>

<p>Here, advancing to the chair, he delivered his commission
to the president, who in turn addressed him, and in conclusion
said:</p>

<p>"We join you in commending the interests of our dearest
country to the protection of Almighty God, beseeching him
to dispose the hearts and minds of its citizens to improve
the opportunity afforded them of becoming a happy and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>
respectable nation. And for you, we address to him our
earnest prayers, that a life so beloved may be fostered with
all his care; that your days may be happy as they have
been illustrious; and that he will finally give you that
reward which this world cannot give."</p>

<p>The great act was now accomplished: Washington retired,
greater, nobler in the estimation of his countrymen than
ever; and followed by their love, esteem, and admiration, he
once more took up his abode in the quiet and peaceful shades
of Mount Vernon, happier in the consciousness of a disinterested
patriotism, than if, as the reward of his toils, he
had attained the proudest diadem on earth.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">State</span> of Naval Affairs of the Colonies at the commencement of the Revolution&mdash;First
Naval Engagement&mdash;Measures adopted by Congress to provide a

<p>Having given some account of the military land operations,
during the Revolutionary struggle, it belongs to this
place to speak of the operations of the American marine,
during the same period.</p>

<p>The colonies were poorly prepared, in respect to the
organization of an army, or the supply of munitions of war,
at the commencement of the contest. The preparations for
the struggle on the ocean were, as might be believed, still
more limited. But few, even of the maritime colonies, had
turned their attention to a naval force as among the means
of defence. Indeed, although the storm had for some years
been gathering, and, to men of forecast, the day of open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>
rupture was likely to arrive, yet, at length, it broke upon
the country suddenly. Besides, maritime preparations for
such a contest long beforehand would have been difficult,
if not impossible. Every measure having such an object in
view would have been regarded with jealousy, and have
brought down the wrath of the mother-country at a still
earlier period than it came. Moreover, the colonies had
no general congress till 1774, and when first convened, and
until hostilities had actually commenced, the object of that
body was rather to obtain a redress of grievances, and thus
prevent war, than by strong and threatening measures, to
hasten an event which all regarded as a general calamity.
In addition to these considerations, in view of the magnitude
and power of the British navy, it was not probably seriously
contemplated, in case of hostilities, that the scene of successful
action could be on the ocean, but only on the land.</p>

<p>No sooner, however, had the struggle actually commenced,
than many of the brave and enterprising commercial and
sea-faring men, began to look with wishful eyes towards
an element which promised, if not honor in competing with
the navy of Great Britain, at least wealth by cruising against
her commerce. At this early period, the seamen of the
the colonies were at home on the deep. They were then,
as now, bold, hardy, and adventurous; and had orders of
capture been issued at an earlier day, it is probable that
the commerce of England would have suffered a signal
interruption and loss.</p>

<p>While the limits of this work forbid a <i>minute</i> history
of the rise, progress, and success of the American navy,
provincial and continental, during the Revolutionary contest,
such notices are subjoined in relation thereto, as will give
the reader an impression of the efforts and prowess of the
Americans, in despite of the obstacles against which they
had to contend.</p>

<p>The news of the battle of Lexington reached Machias, in
Maine, on Saturday, the 9th of May, 1775, and there, as
well as in other parts of the country, roused the indignation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>
of the inhabitants. At this time, there was lying in that port
a British armed schooner, called the <i>Margaretta</i>, convoy to
two sloops which were loading with lumber in behalf of his
majesty's government. Immediately a plan was devised to
seize the officers of the schooner, while in church the next
day. The scheme, however, failed; Captain Moore and
his officers being enabled to escape through the windows
of the church, and effecting their retreat to the schooner.
Immediately she was got under way, and, dropping down
the river, cast anchor in the bay.</p>

<p>The next morning possession was taken of one of the
sloops, and with a volunteer corps of thirty men on board,
sail was made upon her, in quest of the fugitive schooner.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="illus-455.jpg" id="illus-455.jpg"></a>
   <img src="images/illus-455.jpg" alt="First Naval Engagement of the Revolution." title="First Naval Engagement of the Revolution."/>
   <p class="caption2">First Naval Engagement of the Revolution.</p>
</div>

<p>At this time, Captain Moore was ignorant of the commencement
of hostilities, and wishing therefore to avoid a
collision, weighed anchor on the appearance of the sloop,
and stood out to sea. Chase was given, and the sloop being
the better sailer, at length came up with the schooner. The
latter was armed with four light guns, and fourteen swivels.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>
With these a fire was opened, and a man killed on board
the sloop. The latter returned the fire from a wall piece,
which, besides clearing the quarter-deck, killed the helmsman
of the schooner. A further short conflict ensued, when,
by the broaching to of the schooner, the vessels came in
contact; upon which, the Americans boarded her, and took
her into port. Twenty men on both sides were killed and
wounded. Among the former was Captain Moore. Such
was the <i>first naval engagement in the war of the Revolution</i>.
It was wholly a private adventure&mdash;an enterprise on the part
of a party banded together in a moment of excitement, and
successful with fearful chances against them, only through
their superior bravery.</p>

<p>Before the subject of a naval armament was entertained
by congress, three of the colonies&mdash;Massachusetts, Rhode
Island, and Connecticut&mdash;had provided each two vessels,
fitted, armed, and equipped, without the orders or advice
of congress. The precise time when these vessels were
ordered by these colonies cannot, perhaps, be satisfactorily
fixed at this distant period.</p>

<p>Mr. Austin, in his life of the late vice-president Gerry,
accords to that gentleman the honor of having first made
the proposal in the provincial assembly of Massachusetts
for appointing a committee to prepare a law to encourage
the fitting out of armed vessels, and to establish a court for
the trial and condemnation of prizes. "The law reported
by this committee," remarks the biographer, "was passed
by the provincial congress November 10th, 1775, and is the
first actual avowal of offensive hostility against the mother-country,
which is to be found in the annals of the Revolution.
It is not the less worthy of consideration as the first
effort to establish an American naval armament."</p>

<p>It is certain, however, that previous to the above action
of the Massachusetts provincial assembly, but in no respect
derogating from her honor, congress had had the subject of
armed vessels before them, and had adopted resolutions
ordering vessels of a certain description to be provided.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span></p>

<p>The following extracts from the journal of congress for
1775, exhibit the first action of that body on the subject of
a navy: Friday, September 22, 1775, congress appointed a
committee to take into consideration the state of the trade
of America. Thursday, October 5, 1775, Resolved, That a
committee of three be appointed, to prepare a plan for
intercepting two vessels which are on their way to Canada,
laden with arms and powder; and that the committee proceed
on this business immediately.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="illus-457.jpg" id="illus-457.jpg"></a>
   <img src="images/illus-457.jpg" alt="Silas Deane." title="Silas Deane."/>
   <p class="caption2">Silas Deane.</p>
</div>

<p>Pursuant to this resolve, the committee, consisting of Silas
Deane, John Langdon, and John Adams, reported that a
letter be sent to General Washington, advising him of the
sailing of two brigs from England to Quebec, with military
stores; and authorizing him to request of the council of
Massachusetts any two armed vessels in their service, and
dispatch the same to intercept said brigs and cargoes. Also,
that the governors of Rhode Island and Connecticut be
requested to dispatch, the former one or both of the armed
vessels belonging to that colony, and the latter the largest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>
vessel in the service of the colony of Connecticut, on the
same enterprise. This report was accepted, and the resolution
was adopted.</p>

<p>The preceding measures in respect to a naval movement,
were soon followed by others on a more enlarged scale, and
looking still further into the future. Several vessels were
ordered, by sundry resolves, to be fitted out at the expense
of congress&mdash;and among them was one able to carry fourteen
guns, one twenty, and a third not to exceed thirty-six
guns. In November, privateering was authorized, and rules
adopted for the navy. In the following month, a resolve
was adopted for the building of thirteen ships&mdash;five of thirty-two
guns, five of twenty-eight, and three of twenty-four.</p>

<p>Thus it appears that in 1775, congress authorized a regular
marine, consisting of seventeen cruisers, varying in force
from ten to thirty-six guns. These vessels were to be built
in the four colonies of New England, in New York, Pennsylvania,
and Maryland. The following is a list of their
names and respective rates, as well as of the colony where
each was to be built, viz:</p>

<p>Such was the commencement of the American navy.</p>

<p>Ezekiel Hopkins was placed at the head of the navy, with
the title of "commander-in-chief," thus giving him, in respect
to the navy, a rank corresponding to the rank of Washington
in the army. Among the seamen, his usual appellation
was "commodore;" but not unfrequently he was styled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>
"admiral." His pay was one hundred and twenty-five
dollars a-month. Other officers for the navy were appointed
from time to time, as the exigencies of the service required.
Originally, congress left the rank of the several officers to
be regulated by those who were actually in command; but
this gave rise to discontent and dispute; whereupon, in
1776, congress decided the rank of the several captains.
They ranked as follows:</p>

<p>The arrangement of rank of inferior officers was assigned
to the marine committee.</p>

<p>Commodore Hopkins continued to act as commander-in-chief
till January 2d, 1777, when, by a vote of congress, he
was dismissed from the service, for not performing the
duties on which he had been sent with a fleet to the South.
From this date, Captain Nicholson became the senior officer
of the navy, though only with the rank of captain.</p>

<p>The foregoing general view of the proceedings of congress
in relation to the provision and equipment of a naval
armament for the Revolutionary contest, must suffice. Had
their various resolutions been fully carried into effect, more
important results might have been expected from this source
of opposition to Great Britain. But the want of funds, but
much more the want of materials for the final equipment of
vessels which had been launched&mdash;such as guns, anchors,
rigging, &amp;c.&mdash;in some instances retarded, and in others prevented
the completion of vessels which had been ordered,
and which the exigencies of the country so much required.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span></p>

<p>By the act of October, 1775, thirteen frigates were ordered
to be built. Of these, the Raleigh was laid down in New
Hampshire, and in sixty days was launched. But the want
of materials for equipment for some time delayed her
completion.</p>

<p>The Hancock and Boston were built in Massachusetts,
and entered the service.</p>

<p>The Warren and Providence were constructed in Rhode
Island, but were the most indifferent of the thirteen.</p>

<p>The Congress and Montgomery, ordered to be built in
New York, never reached the mouth of the Hudson, being
obliged to be burned in 1777, to prevent their falling into
the hands of the British.</p>

<p>The Maryland, constructed in Virginia, was completed,
and took her place in the service.</p>

<p>The Randolph, the Washington, the Delaware, and the
Effingham were allotted to Pennsylvania. The first of
these was launched in 1776, and sailed on her first cruise
early in 1777. The Delaware was equipped, but is supposed
to have fallen into the hands of the British at the
time they took possession of Philadelphia. The Washington
and the Effingham were burned by the British in 1778.</p>

<p>"Thus, of the thirteen vessels from which so much was
expected, but six got to sea at all in the service in which
they were built. To these were added, in the course of the
war, a few other frigates, some permanently and some only
for single cruises. Of the former class, were the Deane,
(Hague,) Alliance, Confederacy, and Queen of France. It
is believed that these four ships, added to the thirteen ordered
by the law of 1775, and the Alfred and Columbus, will comprise
all the frigate-built vessels that properly belonged to
the marine of the country during the war of the Revolution.
The French vessels that composed most of the squadron of
Paul Jones were lent for the occasion, and we hear no more
of the Pallas after the cruise had ended. She reverted to
her original owners."</p>

<p>During the progress of the war, quite a number of sloops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span>
of war and other vessels were employed by congress, and
some by the commissioners in France. But a complete
catalogue of these, it is now impossible to give.</p>

<p>At the commencement of the Revolution, the flag used
on board of some ships, bore a device, representing a pine-tree
with a rattle-snake coiled at the root, and ready to
strike, with the appropriate motto, "<i>Don't tread on me.</i>"
Some privateers showed flags with devices upon them after
the fancy of their captains or owners; others adopted the
arms of the colony from which they sailed, or by whose
authority they cruised. In 1777, congress adopted the
present national colors.</p>

<p>Many of the officers of the navy were high-spirited and
intelligent men. Not a few of the commanders of privateers&mdash;and
the ocean soon swarmed with them&mdash;were distinguished
for their nautical skill, and were possessed of as
noble and generous impulses as ever actuated the human
bosom. None at the present day can adequately realize
the obstacles which, at that early period, were to be overcome.
Vessels of war were not in existence; even vessels
originally adapted for cruising were not numerous. Besides,
not only was the government poor, but the fortunes of individuals
bore no comparison to some at the present day.
And, moreover, the principal theatre of the war was designed
from the beginning to be on the land. But the maritime
spirit was by no means to be restrained. A writer somewhere
remarks, that the conflict between Great Britain and
her oppressed and despised colonies had not continued a
twelvemonth, when the coasts of the former country were
harassed and agitated by the audacity and enterprise of the
American cruisers. Insurance in England rose to an unprecedented
height. Ship-owners were afraid to trust their
vessels abroad; and few indeed did venture, unless they
were protected by a convoy. England was made to feel,
few and ill-equipped as were the American vessels, compared
with her numerous and well-furnished navy, that
a nation thoroughly imbued with the love of maritime<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span>
adventure, was not to be despised, though she were distant
and poor.</p>

<p>It is remarked by Mr. Hinton that, "in the course of
three years, the Americans had taken more than double
the number of their own guns from the enemy, besides a
great number of merchantmen of value. More than eight
hundred guns had been taken from the enemy during
this time by the marine which congress had fitted out;
while that of Massachusetts and of the other states were
equally successful. The vessels taken by the public and
private armed vessels, from the battle of Lexington to the
17th of March, 1776, when the British evacuated Boston,
amounted to thirty-four, of considerable size and value,
with excellent cargoes. The tonnage of these captured
vessels amounted to three thousand six hundred and forty-five
tons. In 1776, the British vessels captured by the
private armed vessels alone, amounted to the great number
of three hundred and forty-two, of which forty-four were
rëtaken, eighteen released, and five burned. In the following
year, 1777, the success of our privateers was still greater.
Vessels were captured to the amount of four hundred and
twenty-one. The success continued without any great
diminution until 1780. At this time, the British merchants
made so strong an appeal to their government, that they
provided a convoy for every fleet of merchant vessels to
every part of the globe. Out of the fleet sailing from
England to the West Indies, consisting of two hundred in
number, in the year 1777, one hundred and thirty-seven
were taken by our privateers; and from a fleet from Ireland
to the West Indies of sixty sail, thirty-five were taken.
Taking the years 1775, 6, 7, 8, and 9, say for the first year,
thirty-four; second, three hundred and forty-two; third,
four hundred and twenty-one; and for the fourth, which has
not been accurately given, I believe, in any work, say, and
this within bounds, two hundred; and, for the fifth, the
same, two hundred; and allowing but one hundred for the
balance of the time during the war, will make twelve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span>
hundred and ninety-seven, without including those taken by
public vessels from 1776 to the close of the war; and this
latter number, if it could be precisely given, would add
greatly to the list of captures."</p>

<p>The naval names, that have descended to us from this
war with the greatest reputation, are those of Manly, Mugford,
Jones, Barry, Barney, Waters, Young, Tucker, Talbot,
Nicholson, Williams, Biddle, Hopkins, Robinson, Wickes,
Rathburne, and Hacket. Besides these, there were many
others, either in the service of one of the state sovereignties,
at that time, or of congress, who were equally worthy
of notice, but who have been neglected, because they were
only commanders of privateers.</p>

<p>It cannot be doubted that, considering the great number
of privateers that swarmed upon the ocean during the
war, there were sometimes cruelties practiced, and scenes
enacted, disgraceful to the perpetrators. The contrary was
not to be expected. But generally, the commanders of these
privateers were men of principle and humanity. Indeed,
instances of the most magnanimous conduct among them
might be given. In several cases of capture, when they
understood that the owners were friendly to the cause of
America, both the vessel and the crew were suffered to
depart without losing a particle of property. And still further,
the officers of vessels, captured by privateers, as well
as by public armed ships, were never deprived of their
baggage, and often not of their <i>adventures</i>, when they
had any.</p>

<p>From the preceding account of the capture of British
vessels, during the Revolution, by American privateers and
regular ships of war, it can easily be credited that the
ocean must have been the scene of many thrilling and
adventurous exploits. The American seamen were fired
with a patriotism, not less pure and impulsive than the
soldiers on the land. But the story of their bravery, the
hardships they endured, the zeal and courage with which
they fought, unlike that of their compatriots, were left in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span>
great measure unrecorded; or, if noticed in the papers of
the day, were told without those circumstantial details, from
which the chief interest of a naval engagement often arises.
Some privateersmen probably had not the ability to draw
up such accounts, and others who had, not being obliged to
report to the government an account of their engagements,
lacked the inclination, amid the stirring scenes in which
they were engaged. Hence, but few well-authenticated
and circumstantial accounts of the operations of this species
of force have descended to the present time.</p>

<p>The records of engagements by the regular marine are
more abundant, but far from being as copious and circumstantial
as those of the American navy, during the late war
with Great Britain. Enough of interest, however, exists
and more than sufficient for the space which we can allow
to the subject. Indeed, we must leave unnoticed several as
full of interest and as evincive of prowess, as those which
find a place in this volume.</p>



<h4>1. RANDOLPH AND YARMOUTH</h4>


<p>The Randolph, a frigate of thirty-two guns, was launched
at Philadelphia in 1776, and sailed on her first cruise in
1777, being one of the first, if not the very first, of the
new vessels built under the resolution of congress of October,
1775, that proceeded to sea. She was commanded
by Nicholas Biddle, a man combining all the distinguishing
qualifications of a great naval commander.</p>

<p>After having been at sea a few days, a defect in his
masts, and a disposition to mutiny discovered in his crew,
induced him to put into Charleston. On again sailing, he
soon fell in with and captured four Jamaica-men, one of
which, the True-Briton, had an armament of twenty-guns.
With these prizes, he returned to Charleston. The citizens
of that place, pleased with the character and enterprise of
Captain Biddle, placed four small vessels of their own
under his care; with these and the Randolph he proceeded
to sea, in search of several British vessels which had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span>
seen cruising off Charleston for some time. No traces of
them, however, were discovered.</p>

<p>Nothing more was heard from this squadron for some
time. But, at length, intelligence was received of the
most distressing nature. It was contained in a letter of
Captain Vincent, of his Britannic majesty's ship Yarmouth,
sixty-four, dated March 17th, 1778.</p>

<p>On the 7th of that month, the Yarmouth, while cruising
to the east of Barbadoes, discovered six sail bearing south-east,
and standing on a wind. On getting nearer, they were
discovered to be two ships, three brigs, and a schooner.
At nine o'clock P. M., the Yarmouth succeeded in ranging
up on the weather-quarter of the largest and leading
vessel&mdash;the ship, next in size, being astern to leeward.
Here, displaying her colors, the Yarmouth ordered the Randolph
(for so she proved to be) to show her ensign. At this
moment the American flag was run up, and a whole broadside
poured in upon the Yarmouth. A spirited action
immediately ensued, and for twenty minutes was maintained
by both ships with great energy&mdash;when on a sudden
the Randolph blew up. So near were the ships at the time,
that portions of the flying wreck struck the Yarmouth, and
even the American ensign fell upon her forecastle. It was
rolled up, and not even singed.</p>

<p>Immediately following this catastrophe, the Yarmouth
went in pursuit of the other vessels, which, meanwhile,
were attempting to escape. But he was unable to come
up with them, his own sails having been so injured during
the short action had with the Randolph. The chase, therefore,
was relinquished, and the Yarmouth continued to
cruise in the neighborhood. She was still ignorant of the
name of the ill-fated vessel, which she had engaged, nor
was there now any prospect of her ever learning it.</p>

<p>But at length, on the 12th, while passing near to the theatre
of the engagement, signals of distress were discovered
proceeding from persons at a short distance. On reaching
them, they proved to be four men, on a piece of wreck.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span>
On being taken on board of the Yarmouth, they reported
themselves as having belonged to the Randolph, thirty-two,
Captain Biddle, blown up in an action with an English
frigate on the night of the 7th. They had been floating on
the wreck on which they were discovered, without sustenance,
since the time of explosion.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="illus-466.jpg" id="illus-466.jpg"></a>
   <img src="images/illus-466.jpg" alt="The Randolph and Yarmouth." title="The Randolph and Yarmouth."/>
   <p class="caption2">The Randolph and Yarmouth.</p>
</div>

<p>These men reported, that, soon after the action commenced,
Captain Biddle was severely wounded in the
thigh. Being taken below, and seated in a chair, the surgeon
was proceeding to examine his wound, when the
explosion occurred, by which the vessel was blown into
fragments, and the whole crew, officers and men, with the
exception of the four named, were in a moment killed.
The Yarmouth, in the brief time the action lasted, lost five
killed and twelve wounded.</p>

<p>What would have been the result, had not this catastrophe
occurred, no one can say. Captain Biddle was fighting at
fearful odds. But he was young, ardent, ambitious; and,
while we can scarcely refrain from thinking him presumptuous,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>
it is quite apparent, from his actually entering the
lists, that he contemplated a victory over his powerful
antagonist as an achievement quite possible. He was only
twenty-seven years of age. His untimely fate caused a
deep sensation in all quarters; the navy was felt to have
lost a true friend, and the country a zealous patriot.</p>



<h4>2. RALEIGH AND DRUID.</h4>


<p>Under the law of 1775, the Raleigh was constructed in
New Hampshire. She was a fine twelve-pounder frigate,
commanded by Captain Thompson. In the latter part of
August, 1777, for the first time, she went to sea. She was
accompanied by the Alfred, twenty-four, Captain Hinman.
Both vessels were bound to France for military stores.</p>

<p>During the first few days, while running off the coast,
they captured several small vessels; and, on the 2d of September,
fell in with and captured a scow, called the Nancy,
belonging to the outward-bound windward fleet. Learning
the direction of this fleet, which was in the advance of
the Nancy, Captain Thompson went in chase. On the 3d,
the convoy of the fleet was descried. It consisted of the
Camel, Druid, Weasel, and Grasshopper, which had under
their protection sixty merchantmen. At sunset, Captain
Thompson spoke the Alfred, and signified his intention of
running in among the fleet, and, if possible, engaging the
commodore.</p>

<p>By means of the officers of the Nancy, he had obtained
the signals of the fleet, and by means of these he was able
to pass for one of the convoy. The Alfred proving unable
to carry the requisite sail, Captain Thompson left her, and
passed on into the midst of the fleet. His guns being
housed and his ports lowered, she showed no signs of preparation
for an attack. Added to this, making use of the
commodore's signals, he was able to give several of the
merchantmen direction how to steer. Thus he avoided
suspicion, and was able to run the Raleigh alongside of the
vessel of war, and "when within pistol-shot, she hauled up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span>
her courses, run out her guns, set her ensign, and commanded
the enemy to strike." This was a bold movement.
Taken by surprise, the British commander was at an utter
loss how to act. The confusion was general. The sails
got aback. Taking advantage of the perturbation on
board the Druid, (for so she proved,) Captain Thompson
poured in upon her a broadside. This was followed by
a second, third&mdash;twelve broadsides in twenty minutes,
scarcely receiving a shot in return.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="illus-468.jpg" id="illus-468.jpg"></a>
   <img src="images/illus-468.jpg" alt="The Raleigh and Druid." title="The Raleigh and Druid."/>
   <p class="caption2">The Raleigh and Druid.</p>
</div>

<p>While thus engaged, a sudden and violent squall came on,
which, in a measure, slackened the engagement, and rendered
the aim uncertain. As the squall ceased, it was discovered
that the convoy had scattered in all directions,
and were doing their utmost to escape. The other armed
vessels now hastened to the assistance of their crippled
companion. Yet the Raleigh continued to deal out her
thunder, nor did she haul off until the other vessels were
almost within gun-shot of her. Thus compelled, she ran
to leeward, and joined the Alfred. Hoping, however, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span>
the commodore might be induced to renew the engagement,
she shortened sail, thus giving her antagonist an opportunity
to restore his wounded honor; but, instead of this, he hauled
in among his convoy. For several following days the
American ships continued to follow the fleet, but they were
not so fortunate as to receive the respects of any of the
vessels of war.</p>

<p>The Druid, which was of twenty guns, was so much
disabled as to be obliged immediately to return to England.
Her loss was six killed and twenty-six wounded; among the
latter, was her commander, Captain Carteret. Five of the
wounded subsequently died. The Raleigh had three men
killed and wounded.</p>



<h4>3. SUB-MARINE WARFARE</h4>


<p>During the year 1777, David Bushnell, a native of Connecticut,
made several attempts to blow up the ships of the
enemy by means of <i>torpedoes</i>. This mode of warfare
had employed his thoughts during his collegiate course,
so that on graduating in 1775, his plans were in a good
degree matured. An account of some of his early plans
he gave to the world himself. The following is a description
of his celebrated torpedo: "It bore a resemblance to
two upper tortoise shells of equal sizes, placed in contact,
leaving, at that part which represents the head of the
animal, a flue or opening sufficiently capacious to contain
the operator, and air to support him thirty minutes. At the
bottom, opposite to the entrance, was placed a quantity of
lead for ballast. The operator sat upright, and held an oar
for rowing forward or backward, and was furnished with a
rudder for steering. An aperture at the bottom with its
valves admitted water for the purpose of descending, and
two brass forcing-pumps served to eject the water within,
when necessary for ascending. The vessel was made completely
water-tight, furnished with glass windows for the
admission of light, with ventilators and air-pipes, and was so
ballasted with lead fixed on the bottom as to render it solid,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span>
and obviate all danger of oversetting. Behind the sub-marine
vessel was a place above the rudder for carrying a large
powder magazine; this was made of two pieces of oak timber,
large enough, when hollowed out, to contain one hundred
and fifty pounds of powder, with the apparatus used
for firing it, and was secured in its place by a screw turned
by the operator. It was lighter than water, so that he
might rise against the object to which it was intended to
be fastened.</p>

<p>"Within the magazine was an apparatus constructed to
run any proposed period under twelve hours; when it had
run out its time, it unpinioned a strong lock, resembling a
gun-lock, which gave fire to the powder. This apparatus
was so pinioned, that it could not possibly move, until, by
casting off the magazine from the vessel, it was set in motion.
The skillful operator could swim so low on the surface of the
water, as to approach very near the ship in the night, without
fear of being discovered, and might, if he chose, approach
the stem or stern above water, with very little danger. He
could sink very quickly, keep at any necessary depth, and
row a great distance in any direction he desired, without
coming to the surface. When he rose to the top, he could
soon obtain a fresh supply of air, and, if necessary, descend
again and pursue his course."</p>

<p>With a torpedo of the above construction, Bushnell made
an experiment on the Eagle, a sixty-gun ship, then lying in
the harbor of New York, and under command of Lord
Howe. A sergeant of one of the Connecticut regiments
conducted the operation. General Putnam, standing on the
wharf, was a witness of the proceeding.</p>

<p>The sergeant, having under cover of night proceeded to
the ship, attempted to fasten the torpedo to her bottom by
means of a screw. But in this he failed, striking, as he
supposed, a bar or bolt of iron, which resisted the screw.
In attempting to move to another place, he passed from under
the ship, and soon rose to the surface. By this time, daylight
had so far advanced as to make any further experiments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span>
hazardous. He therefore concluded to return to New York.
On passing Governor's island, supposing himself discovered
by the British stationed there, he cast off his magazine, and
proceeded without it. The internal apparatus was set to
run one hour; at the expiration of which, it blew up, in a
tremendous explosion, throwing a vast column of water to
a great height, to the no small wonder of the enemy.</p>

<p>This experiment was followed in the course of the year
by an attempt from a whaling-boat against the frigate Cerebus,
off New London. The expedient adopted in this case
was to draw a machine, loaded with powder, against her
side by means of a line, to be exploded by a gun-lock.
But failing to attach itself as intended, against the frigate, it
became attached to a schooner, at anchor astern of the
frigate, which, on exploding, it demolished.</p>

<p>In a letter addressed to Sir Peter Parker, by Commodore
Simmons, at the time of the explosion on board the Cerebus,
he gave an account of this singular disaster. Being at
anchor to the westward of the town with a schooner which
he had taken, about eleven o'clock in the evening he discovered
a line towing astern from the bows. He believed
some person had been veered away by it, and immediately
began to haul in. A sailor belonging to the schooner taking
it for a fishing-line, laid hold of it, and drew it in about
fifteen fathoms. It was buoyed up by small pieces tied to
it at regular distances. At the end of the rope a machine
was fastened, too heavy for one man to pull up, for it
exceeded one hundred pounds in weight. The other
people of the schooner coming to his assistance, they drew
it upon deck. While the men, to gratify their curiosity,
were examining the machine, it exploded, blew the vessel
into pieces, and set her on fire. Three men were killed,
and a fourth blown into the water, very much injured. On
subsequent examination, the other part of the line was discovered
buoyed up in the same manner; this the commodore
ordered to be instantly cut away, for fear (as he termed
it) of hauling up another of the "<i>infernals</i>!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span></p>

<p>The above mode of warfare cannot but be considered
too shocking and inhuman to be encouraged by civilized
nations, and we do not regret that the experiment of Bushnell,
and the more recent experiments of Fulton, failed. But
it is said that the failure of his efforts cast a deep and permanent
gloom over the mind of Bushnell.</p>



<h4>4. LE BON HOMME RICHARD AND SERAPIS.</h4>


<p>On the 10th of April, 1778, the celebrated John Paul
Jones sailed on a cruise from France, having the Ranger
placed under his command by the American commissioners,
Franklin, Deane, and Lee. In consideration of his previous
valuable services, he was allowed to cruise wherever he
pleased. Accordingly, he directed his course along the
British coast, and for a time kept the people of the maritime
part of Scotland, and part of England, in a state of great
alarm and excitement.</p>

<p>Among his exploits on this cruise, previous to that in
which he engaged the Serapis, his descent upon Whitehaven
was of the boldest character. Two forts, with thirty pieces
of cannon, guarded this port, in which, at the time, were a
hundred vessels at anchor.</p>

<p>"Two parties landed in the night; the forts were seized
and the guns spiked; the few look-outs that were in the
works being confined. In effecting this duty, Captain Jones
was foremost in person; for, having once sailed out of that
port, he was familiar with the situation of the place. An
accident, common to both the parties into which the expedition
had been divided, came near defeating the enterprise
in the outset. They had brought candles in lanterns, for
the double purpose of lights and torches, and, now that they
were about to be used as the latter, it was found that they
were all consumed. As the day was appearing, the party
under Mr. Wallingford, one of the lieutenants, took to its
boat without effecting any thing, while Captain Jones sent
to a detached building, and obtained a candle. He boarded
a large ship, kindled a fire in her steerage, and by placing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span>
a barrel of tar over the spot, soon had the vessel in flames.
This ship lay in the midst of more than a hundred others,
high and dry, the tide being out; Captain Jones took to his
boats, and pulled towards his ship. Some guns were fired
on the retiring boats without effect; but the people of the
place succeeded in extinguishing the flames before the mischief
became very extensive."</p>

   <p class="caption2">Jones setting Fire to the Ships at Whitehaven.</p>
</div>

<p>During this cruise, another bold enterprise was undertaken.
This was an attempt to seize the Earl of Selkirk,
who had a seat on St. Mary's Isle, near the point,
where the Dee flows into the channel. Jones was well
acquainted with the place, his father having been gardener
to the earl, but he was not himself immediately engaged in
the attempt, that being entrusted to a subordinate officer.
The party landed, demanded and took possession of the
house, but, to their great disappointment, the duke himself
was absent. One unauthorized act of the party, Captain
Jones condemned, viz: the seizure of about one hundred
pounds value of plate. This, however, he afterwards purchased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span>
of the crew, and returned to Lady Selkirk, with a
letter expressive of his regrets at the occurrence.</p>

<p>He next steered towards the coast of Ireland, where he
encountered the Drake, twenty, a ship which he had a
sincere desire to meet. On approaching the Ranger, the
Drake hailed, and received the name of her antagonist, by
way of challenge, with a request to come on. As the two
ships were standing on in this manner, the Drake a little to
leeward and astern, the Ranger put her helm up, a man&#339;uvre
that the enemy imitated, and the former gave the first
broadside. The wind admitted of but few changes, but the
battle was fought running fire, under easy canvas. It
lasted an hour and four minutes, when the Drake called for
quarter, her ensign being already cut down.</p>

<p>The English ship was much cut up, both in her hull and
aloft, and Captain Jones computed her loss at about forty
men. Her captain and lieutenant were both desperately
wounded, and died shortly after the engagement. The
Ranger suffered much less, having Lieutenant Wallingford
and one man killed, and six wounded. The Drake was not
only a heavier ship, but she had a much stronger crew than
her antagonist. She had also two guns the most.</p>

<p>With this prize, Jones returned to Brest, where for a
time he remained in hope of receiving a more important
command, and which had brought him to Europe.</p>

<p>After many delays, the king of France purchased for him
the Duras, an old Indiaman, which name Jones exchanged
for Le Bon Homme Richard.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> To this were, added by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span>
order of the French ministry, the Pallas, Cerf, and Vengeance,
and, by Dr. Franklin, commissioner, the Alliance,
thirty-two, then in France. The Cerf and Alliance were
the only vessels of the squadron fitted for war.</p>

<p>With this squadron, Commodore Jones, on the 19th of
June, 1779, sailed from the anchorage under the Isle of
Groix, off l'Orient, bound southward; but, finding it necessary
to return, he left the anchorage a second time, on the
14th of August. About the 23d of September, he fell in
with a fleet of merchantmen, of more than forty sail, under
convoy of the Serapis, forty-four, Captain Richard Pearson,
and the Countess of Seaborough, twenty-two.</p>

<p>The Serapis was a new ship, mounting on her lower
gun-deck, twenty eighteen-pound guns, on her upper gun
deck, twenty nine-pound guns, and on her quarter-deck and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span>
forecastle, ten six-pound guns; making an armament of
fifty guns in the whole. Her crew consisted of three hundred
and twenty men. The Bon Homme Richard was a
single-decked ship, with six old eighteen-pounders mounted
in the gun-room below, and twenty-eight twelve-pounders
on her main or proper gun-deck, with eight nines on her
quarter-deck forecastle, and six in the gangways, making in
all a mixed, or rather light amount of forty-two guns. Her
crew consisted of three hundred and eighty men, of whom
one hundred and thirty-seven were marines or soldiers.</p>

<p>Our narrative will be confined to the action between the
Richard and the Serapis, which proved one of the most
terrible and hotly-contested engagements recorded in the
annals of naval warfare.</p>

   <img src="images/illus-476.jpg" alt="Le Bon Homme Richard and Serapis." title="Le Bon Homme Richard and Serapis."/>
   <p class="caption2">Le Bon Homme Richard and Serapis.</p>
</div>

<p>About half-past seven in the evening, the Richard came
up with the Serapis. Captain Pearson hailed. The answer
of Commodore Jones was designedly equivocal, and, in a
moment after, both ships delivered their entire broadsides.
A sad and destructive catastrophe befel the Richard. Two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span>
of her eighteen guns burst, blowing up the deck above,
and killing or wounding a large proportion of the people
stationed below. This disaster caused all the heavy guns
to be deserted, the men having no longer sufficient confidence
in them to use them. The loss of these reduced the
Richard one-third below that of her rival; in short, it
became a contest between a twelve-pounder and an eighteen
pounder, a species of contest in which it has been said
the former has never been known to prevail. Captain Jones,
however, more than most men, was fitted for desperate circumstances,
and in a moment determined to make up in
rëdoubled activity what was wanting in power of metal.</p>

<p>Nearly an hour was consumed in different man&#339;uvres&mdash;shifting,
firing&mdash;each endeavoring to obtain the advantage
of position; till, at length, the vessels came close together,
but not in a manner which permitted either party to board.
The firing ceased for a few minutes. Captain Pearson,
imagining the enemy had surrendered, demanded, "Have
you struck your colors?" "I have not yet begun to fight!"
vociferated the intrepid Jones.</p>

<p>The ships again separated, and the firing was renewed.
Again they fell upon each other, and in the moment of
collision, Captain Jones, with his own hands, lashed the
enemy's head-gear to his mizen-mast. This brought them
more entirely side by side, and it being desirable on the
part of Captain Jones to retain the enemy in that position,
additional lashings were employed to effect that object.
This was a disappointment to Captain Pearson, but he
determined to be first in boarding, and now made a vigorous
attempt with that object in view, but was repulsed.</p>

<p>"All this time, the battle raged. The lower ports of the
Serapis having been closed, as the vessels swung, to prevent
boarding, they were now blown off, in order to allow
the guns to be run out; and cases actually occurred in
which the rammers had to be thrust into the ports of the
opposite ship, in order to be entered into the muzzles of
their proper guns. It is evident that such a conflict must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span>
have been of short duration. In effect, the heavy metal of
the Serapis, in one or two discharges, cleared all before it,
and the main guns of the Richard were in a great measure
abandoned. Most of the people went on the upper deck,
and a great number collected on the forecastle, where they
were safe from the fire of the enemy, continuing to fight by
throwing grenades and using muskets.</p>

<p>"In this stage of the combat, the Serapis was tearing her
antagonist to pieces below, almost without resistance from
her enemy's batteries, only two guns on the quarter-deck,
and three or four of the twelves, being worked at all. To
the former, by shifting a gun from the larboard side, Commodore
Jones succeeded in adding a third, all of which were
used with effect, under his immediate inspection, to the close
of the action. He could not muster force enough to get over
a second gun. But the combat would now have soon terminated,
had it not been for the courage and activity of the people
aloft. Strong parties had been placed in the tops; at the
end of a short contest, the Americans had driven every man
belonging to the enemy below; after which, they kept up so
animated a fire, on the quarter-deck of the Serapis in particular,
as to drive nearly every man off it, that was not shot down.</p>

<p>"Thus, while the English had the battle nearly all to
themselves below, their enemies had the control above the
upper-deck. Having cleared the tops of the Serapis, some
American seamen lay out on the Richard's main-yard, and
began to throw hand-grenades upon the two upper-decks
of the English ship; the men on the forecastle of their own
vessel seconding these efforts, by casting the same combustibles
through the ports of the Serapis. At length, one
man in particular became so hardy, as to take his post on
the extreme end of the yard, whence, provided with a
bucket filled with combustibles and a match, he dropped
the grenades with so much precision, that one passed
through the main-hatchway. The powder-boys of the
Serapis, had got more cartridges up than were wanted,
and, in their hurry, they had carelessly laid a row of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span>
on the main-deck, in a line with the guns. The grenade
just mentioned, set fire to some loose powder that was lying
near, and the flash passed from cartridge to cartridge
beginning abreast the main-mast, and running quite aft.</p>

<p>"The effect of this explosion was awful. More than
twenty men were instantly killed, many of them being left
with nothing on them but the collars and wristbands of their
shirts, and the waistbands of their duck trowsers; while
the official returns of the ship, a week after the action, show
that there were no less than thirty-eight wounded on board
still alive, who had been injured in this manner, and of
whom thirty were said to have been then in great danger.
Captain Pearson describes this explosion as having destroyed
nearly all the men at the five or six aftermost
guns. On the whole, nearly sixty must have been disabled
by this sudden blow.</p>

<p>"The advantage thus obtained by the coolness and intrepidity
of the topmen, in a great measure restored the chances
of the combat; and, by lessening the fire of the enemy,
enabled Commodore Jones to increase his. In the same
degree that it encouraged the crew of the Richard, it diminished
the hopes of the people of the Serapis. One of the
guns, under the immediate inspection of Commodore Jones,
had been pointed some time against the main-mast of his
enemy, while the two others had seconded the fire of the
tops, with grape and cannister. Kept below decks by this
double attack, where a scene of frightful horror was present
in the agonies of the wounded, and the effects of the explosion,
the spirits of the English began to droop, and there
was a moment when a trifle would have induced them to
submit. From this despondency, they were temporarily
raised, by one of those unlooked-for events that ever
accompany the vicissitudes of battle.</p>

<p>"After exchanging an ineffective and distant broadside
with the Scarborough, the Alliance kept standing off and
on, to leeward of the two principal ships, out of the direction
of their shot, when, about half-past eight, she appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span>
crossing the stern of the Serapis and the bow of the Richard,
firing at such a distance as to render it impossible to
say which vessel would suffer the most. As soon as she
had drawn out of the range of her own guns, her helm was
put up, and she ran down nearly a mile to leeward, hovering
about, until the firing had ceased between the Pallas
and Scarborough, when she came within hail, and spoke
both of these vessels. Captain Cottineau, of the Pallas,
earnestly entreated Captain Landais to take possession of
his prize, and allow him to go to the assistance of the
Richard, or to stretch up to windward in the Alliance himself,
and succor the commodore."<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>At length, Captain Landais determined to go to the assistance
of the Richard, but on reaching the scene of engagement,
he opened a fire which did as much damage to friend
as foe. He was hailed, and informed that he was firing into
the wrong ship. At the time, it was supposed to be a mistake;
but afterwards it was more than conjectured to have
been a wanton and cruel act of revenge on the part of Landais,
who had for some time exhibited strong feelings of
hostility to Captain Jones, and had neglected on several
occasions to follow out his orders.</p>

<p>"Let the injuries have been received," continues Mr.
Cooper, "from what quarter they might, soon after the Alliance
had run to leeward, an alarm was spread in the Richard
that the ship was sinking. Both vessels had been on fire
several times, and some difficulty had been experienced in
extinguishing the flames; but here was a new enemy to contend
with, and as the information came from the carpenter,
whose duty it was to sound the pump-wells, it produced a
great deal of consternation. The Richard had more than a
hundred English prisoners on board, and the master-at-arms,
in the hurry of the moment, let them all up below, in order
to save their lives. In the confusion of such a scene at night,
the master of a letter-of-marque, that had been taken off the
north of Scotland, passed through a port of the Richard into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span>
one of the Serapis, when he reported to Captain Pearson,
that a few minutes would probably decide the battle in his
favor, or carry his enemy down, he himself having been
liberated in order to save his life. Just at this instant, the
gunner, who had little to occupy him at his quarters, came
on deck, and not perceiving Commodore Jones, or Mr. Dale,
both of whom were occupied with the liberated prisoners,
and believing the master, the only other superior he had in
the ship, to be dead, he ran up the poop to haul down the
colors. Fortunately, the flag-staff had been shot away, and,
the ensign already hanging in the water, he had no other
means of letting his intention to submit be known than by
calling out for quarters. Captain Pearson now hailed to
inquire if the Richard demanded quarter, and was answered
by Commodore Jones himself in the negative. It
is probable that the reply was not heard, or if heard, supposed
to come from an unauthorized source; for encouraged
by what he learned from the escaped prisoner, by the cry,
and by the confusion that prevailed in the Richard, the
English captain directed his boarders to be called away,
and, as soon as mustered, they were ordered to take possession
of the prize. Some of the men actually got on the
gunwale of the latter ship, but finding boarders ready to
repel boarders, they made a precipitate retreat. All this
time the topmen were not idle, and the enemy were soon
driven below again with loss.</p>

<p>"In the mean while, Mr. Dale, who no longer had a gun
that could be fought, mustered the prisoners at the pumps,
turning their consternation to account, and probably keeping
the Richard afloat by the very blunder that had come so
near losing her. The ships were now on fire again, and
both parties, with the exception of a few guns on each side,
ceased fighting, in order to subdue this dangerous enemy.
In the course of the combat, the Serapis is said to have
been set on fire no less than twelve times, while towards its
close, as will be seen in the sequel, the Richard was burning
all the while.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span></p>

<p>"As soon as order was restored in the Richard, after the
call for quarter, her chances for success began to increase,
while the English, driven under cover almost to a man,
appear to have lost, in a great degree, the hope of victory.
Their fire materially slackened, while the Richard again
brought a few more guns to bear; the main-mast of the
Serapis began to totter, and her resistance, in general, to
lessen. About an hour after the explosion, or between
three hours and three hours and a half after the first gun
was fired, and between two hours and two hours and a
half after the ships were lashed together, Captain Pearson
hauled down the colors of the Serapis with his own hands,
the men refusing to expose themselves to the fire of the
Richard's tops."</p>

   <p class="caption2">Sinking of the Bon Homme Richard.</p>
</div>

<p>Thus ended a conflict as murderous and sanguinary as
the annals of naval warfare have recorded. Each ship lost
about one hundred and fifty men, or nearly one-half of the
whole number engaged.</p>

<p>At the time of the surrender, the Richard was on fire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span>
and apparently sinking. So imminent was the danger, that
the powder was hastily removed from the magazine, and
placed on the deck, to prevent explosion. Men from the
other ships were sent on board, and the pumps were kept in
motion, and water raised and dashed around until ten o'clock
the next day, before the fire was got under. An examination
of the ship followed, the result of which was, that it was
necessary to abandon her. The wounded were consequently
ordered to be removed, and on the following day, about ten
o'clock, this gallant ship settled slowly into the sea.</p>

<p>The squadron now left the scene of mortal combat, with
the Serapis and Scarborough, the latter having struck to
the Pallas. The former having lost her main-mast, jury
masts were obliged to be rigged; after driving about in the
rough sea until the 6th of October, the squadron and prizes
entered the Texel, the port to which they had been ordered
to repair.</p>



<h4>5. AMERICAN FRIGATE TRUMBULL AND ENGLISH SHIP WATT.</h4>


<p>The action between these two vessels, next to that of the
Richard and Serapis, is supposed to have been the most
severe during the war of the Revolution.</p>

<p>The Trumbull, of thirty-two guns, was commanded by
Captain James Nicholson, a spirited and skillful officer.
During a cruise in June, 1780, a large ship was perceived
bearing down upon the Trumbull's quarter. At half-past
eleven, she hauled a point more to stern of her. The
Trumbull now made sail, hauling upon a wind towards her,
upon which she came down upon the Trumbull's beams.
The latter then took in all her small sails, hauled her courses
up, hove the main-topsail to the mast, cleared for action,
end waited the approach of the enemy.</p>

<p>After several man&#339;uvres on the part of each vessel, Captain
Nicholson discovered that his adversary had thirteen
ports on each side, and eight or ten on her quarter-deck
and forecastle, and of course mounted thirty-six guns. At
twelve, the Trumbull, finding her great superiority as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span>
sailing, and having gotten to windward, determined to avail
herself of the advantage to commence the engagement.</p>

<p>The stranger, observing the design of Captain Nicholson,
fired three shots, and hoisted British colors as a challenge.
The Trumbull wore after her, hoisting British colors, with
an intention of getting alongside. A private signal was
made in turn by the British ship, which not being answered
she opened a broadside at a hundred yards distance. The
Trumbull, upon this, run up the continental colors, and
returned the fire.</p>

<p>Such was the commencement of an action of three hours'
continuance. There was bravery, determination, on both
sides. During the greater part of the action, the vessels
were not fifty yards apart, and at one time, they were
nearly enlocked.</p>

<p>Twice was the Trumbull set on fire by means of wads
from the other vessel. Her masts and rigging were greatly
injured. Observing, at length, that her masts were in
imminent danger of going by the board, the first lieutenant
informed Captain Nicholson of the danger, and begged him
to abandon further attempt to take the enemy's ship, as
without masts they should be at his mercy.</p>

<p>It was with great reluctance that Captain Nicholson
adopted the course suggested. He was confident that
with one half-hour more, he should have been able to have
achieved the victory. But yielding to stern necessity, and
the dictates of humanity, he gave up the contest. He lost
his main and mizen-top-mast, when only musket-shot distant
from the other vessel. At length, only her fore-mast was left,
and that was badly wounded and sprung. She had eight
men killed, and twenty-one wounded, nine of whom died
after the action. Her crew consisted of one hundred and
ninety-nine men. The English ship proved to be the Watt,
letter-of-marque. She had upwards of ninety men killed and
wounded. Not less than one hundred balls struck her hull.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span></p>



<h4>6. ALLIANCE, ATALANTA, AND TREPASSEY.</h4>


<p>In February, 1781, Captain Barry, of the frigate Alliance,
of thirty-two guns, sailed from Boston for l'Orient, having
on board Colonel Lawrence, destined to France on an
important embassy to the French court. Having landed
Mr. Lawrence, he sailed on a cruise.</p>

<p>On the 28th of May, two sail were discovered on the
weather-bow of the Alliance, standing towards her. After
having approached sufficiently near to be discovered by
Captain Barry, they hauled to wind, and stood on the same
course with the Alliance. On the 29th, at day-break, the
wind lulled. At sunrise, the Alliance displayed the American
colors, and preparations were made for action. The
men look their stations.</p>

<p>The vessels with which the Alliance was now to contend
were a ship and a brig, displaying English colors&mdash;the
Atalanta, Captain Edwards, carrying twenty guns and one
hundred and thirty men, and the Trepassey, of fourteen
guns and eighty men, under command of Captain Smith.</p>

<p>The advantage was, both as to men and guns, on the side
of the British; but more than this, as the Alliance must
necessarily engage both at the same time. But Captain
Barry, no way daunted, determined to do his duty as an
officer and a patriot. He, therefore, summoned them to
strike their colors. To such a summons they had, of
course, no inclination to accede, and the engagement
opened with a spirit corresponding to the interest at stake.
Unfortunately for the Alliance, a perfect calm prevailed&mdash;and
on the bosom of the water she lay, in respect to motion,
as a thing devoid of life. The opposing vessels had
sweeps, and were therefore able to choose their positions.
And the most advantageous positions they did choose&mdash;they
lay on the quarters, and athwart the stern of the Alliance.
Consequently, but few of her guns could be brought to bear.</p>

<p>Added to these untoward circumstances, there soon
occurred, on board the Alliance, a still greater misfortune.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span>
A grape-shot struck the shoulder of Captain Barry, inflicting
a severe and dangerous wound. But he neither heeded
its pain nor its danger, but continued on the quarter-deck,
marking the progress of the action, and giving his orders
as occasion required. At length, however, by reason of
loss of blood, he was obliged to be borne below. At this
time, the American flag was shot away, and fell. There
was a momentary pause on board the Alliance, which the
enemy construing into a surrender, they filled the air with
loud rejoicings.</p>

<p>But they mistook. The flag had been shot down, not
hauled down. The supposed pause was only the needful
interval occupied in rëloading. The colors were soon rëinstalled,
and again floated as proudly as before; and a full
broadside from the Alliance showed to her foes how the
interval had been occupied. That broadside rëcalled them
to their quarters. Fortunately, about this time, a welcome
breeze, though still light, sprung up. The sails of the
Alliance, which had scarcely served any purpose during
the engagement, and seemed destined to acquire no honor
in the coming victory&mdash;the sails were no longer idle.
They soon brought the vessel into a more favorable position.
This circumstance added to the confidence and
rëdoubled the efforts of the seamen. Broadside followed
broadside in quick succession, and did all desirable execution.
At three o'clock in the afternoon the action terminated:
the Alliance was the victor.</p>

<p>On being ushered into the presence of Barry, Captain
Edwards presented his sword; which, however, the former
declined taking, observing, "that he richly merited it, and
that his king ought to give him a better ship."</p>

<p>The importance of firmness and perseverance, in a
commander, was well illustrated during the above engagement.
Soon after Barry received his wound, and had
been obliged to go below, one of his lieutenants, disheartened
by the misfortune which had befallen his commander,
and appalled by the fearful devastation which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span>
seemed to be making by the enemy with the ship's spars
and rigging, repaired to him, and proposed that the colors
should be struck.</p>

<p>Barry started. The colors be struck! no such thought
had entered his mind. The colors be struck! "No!" said
he; "if the ship can't be fought without me, carry me at
once on deck." The lieutenant, if ashamed, was also
rëanimated. He repaired on deck, went round among the
crew, and made known Barry's courage and determination.
There was but one response among the brave tars. They
decided to "stick to him manfully." And they did. From
that moment "the ship <i>was fought</i>"&mdash;and fought without
the presence of Barry. But no sooner was his wound
dressed, than he insisted on being aided in ascending to the
deck; before reaching it, however, the enemy had struck.
Brave seamen! brave commander!</p>

<p>The Alliance had eleven killed during the action, and
twenty-one wounded. Among the latter, were several
officers. She had suffered terribly in her spars and rigging.
The loss of the enemy was eleven killed and thirty
wounded.</p>



<h4>7. CONGRESS AND SAVAGE.</h4>


<p>The Savage was a British sloop, carrying twenty guns
and about one hundred and fifty men. In September, 1781,
while on a cruise along the Southern coast of the United
States, she entered the Potomac, and plundered the estate
of Washington, then in another quarter, commanding the
American army. It was an expedition unworthy a high-minded
and honorable officer, and a well-merited rebuke
was soon after meted out to him.</p>

<p>On leaving the Potomac, the Savage fell in with the
American privateer Congress, Captain Geddes, off Charleston.
The vessels were of the same force. On board the
Congress, at the time, was Major McLane, a distinguished
American officer, who with a part of his command had volunteered
to serve as marines. As the crew of the Savage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span>
were all seamen, she had decidedly the advantage, in
respect to the Congress, whose crew, in part, were landsmen,
unacquainted with marine warfare.</p>

<p>The vessels were now within cannon distance. The
Congress commenced by firing her bow-chasers. This
was at half-past ten in the morning. At eleven, they
had approximated so near each other, that the landsmen
employed their musketry, and with effect. A sharp and
destructive cannonade followed on both sides.</p>

<p>At the commencement of the engagement, the advantage
lay with the Savage. Her position being on the Congress'
bows, was favorable for raking. But a closer engagement
followed, and the tide turned in favor of the privateer. So
well did she man&#339;uvre, so promptly, so dextrously, that
she soon disabled her enemy. At the expiration of an hour,
the braces and bowlines of the Savage were shot away.
Not a rope was left by which to trim the sails. The musketry
of the Americans had cleared her decks. In this
situation, it was deemed impossible that she could much
longer continue the contest. Indeed, she was already
nearly a wreck&mdash;her sails, rigging, and yards were so shattered
as to forbid her changing her position, but with the
greatest difficulty. She would not, however, surrender,
but rëcommenced a vigorous cannonade. Again her quarter-deck
and forecastle were cleared by the fatal musketry
of the American landsmen. Three guns on her main deck
were rendered useless. The vessels were now so near
each other, that the fire from the guns scorched the men
opposed to them in the other. At length, the mizen-mast
of the Savage was shot away. At this instant, the boatswain
of the Savage appeared forward, with his hat off,
calling for quarter. But it was half an hour before the
crew of the Congress could board her, by reason of the loss
of their boats. But, on reaching her, she was found to be
scarcely more than a wreck. Her decks were covered
with blood, and killed and wounded men.</p>

<p>The Congress had thirty men killed and wounded. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span>
Savage had twenty-three killed and thirty-one wounded.
Among the latter, was her commander, Captain Sterling.</p>

<p>The marine service often furnished examples of great
heroism and most patriotic endurance. Such an instance
occurred on board the Congress. After the action terminated,
Major McLane went forward to ascertain what
had become of his sergeant, Thomas. He found the poor
fellow lying on his back in the netting, near the foot of the
bowsprit, with his musket loaded, but both legs broken.
"Poor fellow!" thought the major, as he beheld him; "poor
fellow!" But the <i>poor fellow</i> began huzzaing lustily for the
victory achieved; and followed his exulting and even vociferous
huzzas by a corresponding exclamation addressed to
his major: "Well, major, if they have broken my legs, my
hands and my heart are still whole."</p>

<p>Sergeant Thomas was terribly wounded, but the kind-hearted
major did not neglect him. The best care was
taken of him; ultimately, he recovered; and, nothing
deterred by the painful experience he had had of the sometimes
ill-fortune of war, he entered on board the Hyder
Ali, commanded by Captain Barney.</p>

<p>It is ever delightful to record instances of high-minded
and magnanimous conduct on the part of victors towards
the vanquished. This engagement furnishes one most honorable
to the American character. The officers and crew
of the Savage were treated with the greatest kindness
and attention. Major McLane even accompanied Captain
Sterling into Pennsylvania, to secure him from insult, his
treatment of American prisoners having rendered him
highly obnoxious to the patriots.</p>

<p>Such is a brief account of some of the exploits of the
American marine during the war of the Revolution.
There were others perhaps equally honorable to the skill
and enterprise of our naval officers, but which our limits
forbid us to notice. On the breaking out of the war, the
country was poorly prepared to enter the lists with the
mistress of the ocean. Indeed, it was not until 1776, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span>
the forbearing policy of congress was abandoned, and the
nautical enterprise of the country was let loose upon
British commerce. From that time, however, American
valor was exhibited in its true and persevering spirit, and
contributed, as far as it had scope, in inducing the mother-country
to acknowledge the independence of her wayward
child&mdash;which she did on the 20th of January, 1783.</p>

<p>Upon this most desirable event, orders of recall were
issued to all naval commanders; and the commissions of
privateers and letters of marque were annulled. On the
11th of April following, a proclamation from the proper
authorities announced the cessation of hostilities. From
this time, as the glad intelligence spread, the helms of our
warlike ships were turned towards our home ports, leaving
the merchantmen again to the peaceful possession of that
element, which for years they had traversed, if at all, at the
greatest hazard.</p>

<p>In the preceding pages, we have had occasion to trace
the causes and events of that struggle which resulted in
the independence of the United States; and, in so doing,
incidental mention has been made of some of the leading
men of England, who figured in the cabinet, in the field,
and on the ocean; with the part they acted either in favor
of, or in opposition to the grand object of the colonies in
their contest with the mother-country. Judging from his
own early desires, the author persuades himself that he
will be conferring a favor upon his readers by giving some
brief sketches, in this place, of those distinguished men,
and of others, who contributed to retard or accelerate the
final result. Such notices of the most prominent, we proceed
to give, beginning with the monarch, the great fountain
of power and law, then on the throne of Great Britain.</p>



<h4>GEORGE III.</h4>


<p>George III. was born in 1738, and succeeded to the throne
on the death of his grandfather, George II., October 25,
1760, about the time the troubles with America began. At
this period, principally through the lofty spirit and political
sagacity of Pitt, afterwards Earl of Chatham, who was,
and for some time had been, at the head of the administration,
the affairs of the nation were in a most prosperous
state. The army and navy were highly efficient, and
flushed with recent conquests; the revenue flourished;
commerce was increasing; the people were loyal; and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span>
perhaps, no prince had ascended the throne of his ancestors
with more flattering prospects than George the Third.</p>

<p>Soon after ascending the throne, the king evinced a
determination to procure a general peace. In this measure
he differed from his great minister, Pitt, who, on that
account, retired from office, October 5, 1761. Peace, however,
contrary to the wishes and designs of the king could
not be obtained on a just basis, and the war proceeded.</p>

<p>In May, 1762, Lord Bute, a particular favorite of the
king, who had contrived to gain a remarkable ascendancy
over him, succeeded the Duke of Newcastle, as first lord
of the treasury. Preliminaries of peace between England,
France, and Spain, were signed on the 3d of November,
and the definite treaty followed, February 10th, 1763.
The people, however, were by no means pacifically
inclined, or contented with the political ascendancy of
Lord Bute, whose administration was attacked with unsparing
severity by several popular writers, particularly by the
celebrated John Wilkes, in his periodical paper, called the
North Briton. The arrest of Wilkes, and the seizure of
his papers under a general warrant, issued by the secretary
of state for the home department, increased the indignation
and clamors of the people; Lord Bute was execrated
throughout the country, and the king himself became
exceedingly unpopular. The removal of the favorite, and
the appointment of George Grenville to the head of the
treasury, having failed to allay the national irritation, Pitt,
it is asserted, was at length summoned to court, and
requested to make arrangements for forming a new ministry;
but he presumed, it is added, to dictate such arrogant
terms, that, rather than submit to them, the king said
he would place the crown on Pitt's head, and submit his
own neck to the axe.</p>

<p>In 1764, the king suggested to Grenville the taxation of
America, as a grand financial measure for relieving the
mother-country from the heavy war expenses, which, it
was unjustly claimed, had chiefly been incurred for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span>
security of the colonies. The minister was startled, and
raised objections to the proposal, which, however, were
overruled by the king, who plainly told him that, if he were
afraid to adopt such a measure, others might easily be found
who possessed more political courage. At length, Grenville
reluctantly brought the subject before parliament;
and, in spite of a violent opposition, the stamp act, so
important in its consequences, was passed in the following
year. The most alarming irritation prevailed among the
colonists of America.</p>

<p>The Rockingham party, which now came into power,
procured the repeal of the stamp act; but, notwithstanding
this and some other popular measures of the new cabinet,
it was dissolved in the summer of 1766. The Duke of
Grafton succeeded Lord Rockingham, as first lord of the
treasury, and Pitt (then Earl of Chatham) took office as
lord privy seal. In the following year, Charles Townshend,
chancellor of the exchequer, proposed the taxation of certain
articles imported by the American colonists; and, early in
1768, Lord Chatham retired in deep disgust from the
administration, which, during the preceding autumn, had
been weakened by the succession of Lord North to Charles
Townshend, as chancellor of the exchequer. Some other
official changes took place; one of the most important of
which, perhaps, was the appointment of Lord Hillsborough
to the new colonial secretaryship.</p>

<p>The aspect of affairs in America grew more serious every
hour: the deputies of Massachusetts declared taxation by
the British parliament to be illegal; a scheme for a general
congress of the different states was proposed, and an open
rupture with the mother-country was evidently approaching.
Blind to the consequences of their fatal policy, the
king and his ministers, however, persisted in those measures,
with regard to the trans-Atlantic colonies, which eventually
produced a dismemberment of the empire.</p>

<p>In January, 1770, the Duke of Grafton resigned all his
employments; but, unfortunately for America, he was succeeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span>
by Lord North, who increased rather than alleviated
the national calamities, and was decidedly with the king in
his determination never to yield to the demands of the colonists,
but to coerce them to submission, however unjustly, by
the arm of power.</p>

<p>In 1782, Lord North was compelled to resign, and the
Rockingham party, friendly to the independence of America,
came into office; but the new administration soon afterwards
broke up, on account of the sudden death of the premier.
Lord Shelburne was now placed at the head of the treasury,
and Pitt, son of the great Earl of Chatham, became chancellor
of the exchequer.</p>

<p>In 1783, a general peace was concluded, and the United
States procured a formal acknowledgment of their independence.
When Adams, the first American envoy, attended at
the levee, the king, to whom he was personally disagreeable,
received him with dignified composure, and said, "I was the
last man in England to acknowledge the independence of
America, but having done so, I shall also be the last to
violate it." This was highly honorable to the king.
America was a jewel in the British crown which was
increasing in lustre, to part with which was truly painful
to royal ambition. Nor did George III. consent to any
acts which tended to this relinquishment, only as he was
compelled to it by the ill success of his armies in America,
and the clamorous demands for peace by his subjects at
home. But having, at length, parted with this jewel, and
having acknowledged the independence of America, he
nobly declared his intention to live in peace with this newborn
empire.</p>



<h4>JOHN BURGOYNE.</h4>


<p>General Burgoyne was the natural son of Lord Bingley.
At an early age he entered the army; and while quartered
with his regiment at Preston, married Lady Charlotte Stanley,
whose father, the Earl of Derby, was so incensed at
the match, that he threatened utterly to discard her; but a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span>
reconciliation at length took place, and the earl allowed her
three hundred pounds a-year during his life, and, by his will,
bequeathed her a legacy of twenty-five thousand pounds.
The influence of the family to which Burgoyne had thus
become allied, tended materially to accelerate his professional
advance. In 1762, he acted as brigadier-general of
the British forces which were sent out for the defence of
Portugal against France and Spain.</p>

<p>In 1775, he was appointed to a command in America;
whence he returned in the following year, and held a long
conference with the king on colonial affairs. Resuming his
post in 1777, he addressed a proclamation to the native
Indians, in which he invited them to his standard, but
deprecated, with due severity, the cruel practice of scalping.
The pompous turgidity of style, in which this address
was couched, excited the ridicule of the Americans, and
procured for General Burgoyne the soubriquet of "<i>Chrononhotonthologos</i>."
His first operations were successful:
he dislodged the enemy from Ticonderoga and Mount
Independence, and took a large number of cannon, all their
armed vessels and batteries, as well as a considerable part
of their baggage, ammunition, provisions, and military stores.
But his subsequent career was truly disastrous; his troops
suffered much from bad roads, inclement weather, and a
scarcity of provisions; the Indians, who had previously
assisted him, deserted; and the Americans, under General
Gates, surrounded him with a superior force, to which,
although victorious in two engagements, he was, at length,
compelled to capitulate at Saratoga, with the whole of his
army. This event, which rendered him equally odious to
ministers and the people, was, for some time, the leading
topic of the press; and numberless lampoons appeared, in
which the general's conduct was most severely satirized.
The punsters of the day, taking advantage of the American
general's name, amused themselves unmercifully at Burgoyne's
expense; but of all their effusions, which, for the
most part, were virulent rather than pointed, the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</a></span>
harmless epigram, poor as it is, appears to have been one
of the best:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Burgoyne, unconscious of impending fates,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Could cut his way through woods, but not through <span class="smcap">Gates</span>."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In May, 1778, he returned to England, on his parole, but
the king refused to see him. Burgoyne solicited a court-martial,
but in vain. In 1779, he was dismissed the service
for refusing to return to America. Three years after, however,
he was restored to his rank in the army, appointed
commander-in-chief in Ireland, and sworn in one of the
privy-council of that kingdom. He died suddenly of a fit
of the gout, at his house in Hertford street, on the 4th of
August, 1792; and his remains were interred in the cloisters
of Westminster abbey.</p>

<p>It would, perhaps, be rash to pronounce a positive opinion
of the merits of Burgoyne, as a commander. He boldly
courted a scrutiny into the causes which led to his surrender
at Saratoga, which ministers refused, because, as it has
been insinuated, such a proceeding might expose the absurd
imprudence and inefficiency of their own measures with
regard to the American war. Prior to the capitulation, his
military career, as well in America as Portugal, had been
rather brilliant; his misfortune was precisely that which
befel Cornwallis; but, unlike the latter, Burgoyne was not
allowed an opportunity of redeeming his reputation.</p>

<p>In parliament, he was a frequent and fluent, but neither a
sound nor an impressive speaker. While in employment,
he appears to have been a staunch advocate for the American
war; which, however, he severely reprobated, from the
time that he ceased to hold a command. He was a writer,
chiefly dramatic, of considerable merit.</p>



<h4>SIR HENRY CLINTON.</h4>


<p>This distinguished general was a grandson of the Earl
of Clinton, and was born about the year 1738. After having
received a liberal education, he entered the army, and
served for some time in Hanover. In the early part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span>
the revolutionary struggle he came to America, and was
present at the battle of Bunker's hill; from which time to
the close of the American war, he continued to aid the
British cause. In 1777, he was made a Knight of the
Bath, and in January, 1778, commander-in-chief of the
British forces in America. On his return to England, a
pamphlet war took place between him and Cornwallis, as to
the surrender of the latter, the entire blame of which each
party attributed to the other. In 1793, he obtained the
governorship of Gibraltar, in possession of which he died
on the 23d of December, 1795.</p>

   <img src="images/illus-497.jpg" alt="Sir Henry Clinton." title="Sir Henry Clinton."/>
   <p class="caption2">Sir Henry Clinton.</p>
</div>

<p>The merits of Sir Henry Clinton, as a commander, have
been variously estimated; and, as is usually the case, the
truth seems to be intermediate between the panegyric of
his friends and the censure of his enemies. That he was
endowed with bravery, and possessed a considerable share
of military skill, cannot, in fairness, be denied; but he was
decidedly unequal to the great difficulties of his situation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</a></span>
and unfit to contend against so lofty a genius as Washington,
supported by a people resolved on obtaining their independence,
and fighting on their native soil.</p>



<h4>ISAAC BARRE.</h4>


<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="illus-498.jpg" id="illus-498.jpg"></a>
   <img src="images/illus-498.jpg" alt="Colonel Barre." title="Colonel Barre."/>
   <p class="caption2">Colonel Barre.</p>
</div>

<p>Colonel Barre was born in Ireland, about the year 1726.
He served at Quebec, under Wolfe, in the picture of whose
death, by Benjamin West, his figure is conspicuous. The
Earl of Shelburne procured him a seat in parliament,
where, acting in opposition to government, he was not only
deprived of his offices of adjutant-general and governor
of Stirling castle, which he had received as a reward for
his services in America, but dismissed from the service.
During the Rockingham administration, he was compensated
for the loss which he had sustained, by being voted a
pension of three thousand two hundred pounds per annum;
which he subsequently relinquished, pursuant to an arrangement
with Pitt, on obtaining a lucrative, but not distinguished
office. He usually took office when his party<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</a></span>
predominated; and was, in the course of his career, a privy
counsellor, vice treasurer of Ireland, paymaster of the
forces, and treasurer of the navy. His best speeches were
delivered during North's administration, on the American
war, to which he appears to have been inflexibly opposed.
His oratory was powerful, but coarse; his manner, rugged;
his countenance, stern; and his stature, athletic. He was
suspected, but apparently without reason, of having assisted
in writing the letters of Junius. For the last twenty years
of his life, he was afflicted with blindness, which, however,
he is said to have borne with cheerful resignation. His
death took place on the 20th of July, 1792.</p>



<h4>CHARLES TOWNSHEND.</h4>


<p>Charles Townshend, son of Viscount Townshend, was
born 1725. From his youth, he was distinguished for great
quickness of conception and extraordinary curiosity. In
1747, he went into parliament, and continued a member till
he died. He held various offices in the government. In
1765, he was paymaster general, and chancellor of the
exchequer; and a lord of the treasury in August, 1766,
from which period he remained in office until his decease,
which took place on the 4th of September, 1767.</p>

<p>In person, Charles Townshend was tall and beautifully
proportioned; his countenance was manly, handsome,
expressive, and prepossessing. He was much beloved in
private life, and enjoyed an unusual share of domestic
happiness.</p>

<p>Burke, in his speech on American taxation, thus admirably
depicted the general character of Charles Townshend:
"Before this splendid orb (alluding to the great Lord
Chatham) had entirely set, and while the western horizon
was in a blaze with his descending glory, on the opposite
quarter of the heavens arose another luminary, and for his
hour he became lord of the ascendant. This light, too, is
passed, and set for ever! I speak of Charles Townshend,
officially the rëproducer of this fatal scheme (American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</a></span>
taxation); whom I cannot even now remember, without
some degree of sensibility. In truth, he was the delight
and ornament of this house, and the charm of every private
society which he honored with his presence. Perhaps
there never arose in this country, nor in any country, a
man of more pointed and finished wit, and (where his passions
were not concerned) of a more refined, exquisite, and
penetrating judgment. If he had not so great a stock, as
some have had who flourished formerly, of knowledge long
treasured up, he knew better by far, than any man I ever
was acquainted with, how to bring together, within a short
time, all that was necessary to establish, to illustrate, and
to decorate that side of the question he supported. He
stated his matter skillfully and powerfully; he particularly
excelled in a most luminous explanation and display of his
subject."</p>



<h4>CHARLES CORNWALLIS, MARQUIS.</h4>


<p>Lord Cornwallis, eldest son of the fifth lord, and first
Earl Cornwallis, was born 1738. At the age of twenty, he
entered the army, and obtained a captaincy. In 1762, on
the death of his brother, he took his seat in the house of
lords. In 1770, he and three other young peers, having
protested, with Lord Camden, against the taxation of
America, Mansfield, the chief justice, is said to have sneeringly
observed, "Poor Camden could only get four boys to
join him!"</p>

<p>Although he had opposed the measures of the government
with regard to the disaffected colonies, yet when hostilities
commenced, he did not scruple to accept of active
employment against the Americans. His history, during
the war, will be found in the preceding pages. He was a
proud man, and most humiliating was it when he was
obliged to surrender to Washington at Yorktown.</p>

<p>But his failure in America did not impair his reputation.
On his return to England, he was made governor of the
Tower. In 1786, he was sent to Calcutta, as governor-general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</a></span>
and commander-in-chief. Having terminated, successfully,
a war in that country, he returned to England.
In 1799, he became lord-lieutenant of Ireland. Soon after
the expiration of his vice-regency, he was sent to France
as plenipotentiary for Great Britain, in which capacity he
signed the treaty of Amiens. In 1804, he succeeded the
Marquis Wellesley, as governor-general of India. On his
arrival at Calcutta, he proceeded, by water, to take the
command in the upper provinces. The confinement of the
boat, the want of exercise, and the heat of the weather,
had a most serious effect on his health. Feeling, soon after
he had landed, that his dissolution was at hand, he prepared
some valuable instructions for his successor; and the last
hours of his life were passed in taking measures to lessen
the difficulties which his decease would produce. He
expired at Ghazepoore, in Benares, on the 5th of October,
1805.</p>

<p>Lord Cornwallis was not endowed with any brilliancy
of talent. He had to contend with no difficulties, on his
entrance into life: high birth procured him a military
station, which his connexions enabled him to retain, after
he had committed an error, or, at least, met with a mischance,
that would have utterly ruined a less influential
commander. Although ambitious, he appears to have possessed
but little ardor. He manifested no extraordinary
spirit of enterprise; he hazarded no untried man&#339;uvres;
and yet, few of his contemporaries passed through life with
more personal credit or public advantage. He had the
wisdom never to depute to others what he could perform
himself. His perseverance, alacrity, and caution, procured
him success as a general, while his strong common sense
rendered him eminent as a governor. He always evinced
a most anxious desire to promote the welfare of those who
were placed under his administration; Ireland and Hindostan
still venerate his memory. His honor was unimpeachable;
his manners, devoid of ostentation; and his private
character, altogether amiable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</a></span></p>

<p>Napoleon Buonaparte, in his conversations with Barry
O'Meara, declared that Lord Cornwallis, by his integrity,
fidelity, frankness, and the nobility of his sentiments, was
the first who had impressed upon him a favorable opinion
of Englishmen. "I do not believe," said the ex-emperor,
"that he was a man of first-rate abilities; but he had talent,
great probity, sincerity, and never broke his word. Something
having prevented him from attending at the Hôtel de
Dieu, to sign the treaty of Amiens, pursuant to appointment,
he sent word to the French ministers that they might
consider it completed, and that he would certainly execute
it the next morning. During the night, he received instructions
to object to some of the articles; disregarding which,
he signed the treaty as it stood, observing that his government,
if dissatisfied, might refuse to ratify it, but that,
having once pledged his word, he felt bound to abide by it.
There was a man of honor!" added Napoleon; "a true
Englishman."</p>



<h4>LORD CHATHAM.</h4>


<p>William Pitt, Earl of Chatham, was born November 15,
1708. His father was Robert Pitt, of Boconnock, in the
county of Cornwall. He received his education at Trinity
college, Cambridge. He took a seat in parliament as early
as 1735, as a member for Old Sarum. His exalted talents,
his lofty spirit, and commanding eloquence, soon rendered
him singularly conspicuous. Under George II., in 1757, he
became premier of that celebrated war administration,
which raised England to a proud prëeminence over the
other nations of Europe. His energy was unbounded.
"It must be done," was the reply he often made, when told
that his orders could not be executed. After which, no
excuse was admitted. Under his auspices, England triumphed
in every quarter of the globe. In America, the
French lost Quebec; in Africa, their chief settlements
fell; in the East Indies, their power was abridged; in
Europe, their armies suffered defeat; while their navy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</a></span>
was nearly annihilated, and their commerce almost reduced
to ruin.</p>

<p>On the accession of George the Third, Pitt, who felt
strongly impressed with the policy of declaring war against
Spain, was thwarted in his wishes by the influence of Lord
Bute; and, disdaining to be nominally at the head of a
cabinet which he could not direct, he resigned his office in
October, 1761.</p>

   <p class="caption2">Lord Chatham.</p>
</div>

<p>In 1764, he greatly distinguished himself by his opposition
to general warrants, which, with all his accustomed
energy and eloquence, he stigmatized as being atrociously
illegal. A search for papers, or a seizure of the person,
without some specific charge, was, he contended, repugnant
to every principle of true liberty. "By the British constitution,"
said he, "every man's house is his castle! not that
it is surrounded by walls and battlements; it may be a
straw-built shed; every wind of heaven may whistle round
it; all the elements of nature may enter it; but <i>the king
cannot; the king dare not</i>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</a></span></p>

<p>He invariably opposed, with the whole force of his eloquence,
the measures which led to the American war: and
long after his retirement from office, he exerted himself
most zealously to bring about a reconciliation between the
mother-country and her colonies; But when the Duke of
Portland, in 1778, moved an address to the crown, on the
necessity of acknowledging the independence of America,
Lord Chatham, although he had but just left a sick bed,
opposed the motion with all the ardent eloquence of his
younger days. "My lords," said he, "I lament that my
infirmities have so long prevented my attendance here, at
so awful a crisis. I have made an effort almost beyond my
strength to come down to the house on this day, (<i>and perhaps
it will be the last time I shall be able to enter its walls</i>,)
to express my indignation at an idea which has gone forth
of yielding up America. My lords: I rejoice that the grave
has not yet closed upon me; that I am still alive to lift up
my voice against the dismemberment of this ancient and
most noble monarchy. Pressed down, as I am, by the hand
of infirmity, I am little able to assist my country in this
most perilous conjuncture; but, my lords, while I have
sense and memory, I will never consent to deprive the
royal offspring of the house of Brunswick of their fairest
inheritance."</p>

<p>The Duke of Richmond having replied to this speech,
Lord Chatham attempted to rise again, but fainted, and fell
into the arms of those who were near him. The house
instantly adjourned, and the earl was conveyed home in a
state of exhaustion, from which he never recovered. His
death took place at Hayes, early in the following month,
namely, on the 11th of May, 1778. The House of Commons
voted the departed patriot, who had thus died gloriously
at his post, a public funeral, and a monument in
Westminster abbey at the national expense. An income
of four thousand pounds per annum was annexed to the
earldom of Chatham, and the sum of twenty thousand pounds
cheerfully granted to liquidate his debts: for, instead of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</a></span>
profiting by his public employments, he had wasted his
property in sustaining their dignity, and died in embarrassed
circumstances.</p>

<p>In figure, Lord Chatham was eminently dignified and
commanding. "There was a grandeur in his personal
appearance," says a writer, who speaks of him when in his
decline, "which produced awe and mute attention; and,
though bowed by infirmity and age, his mind shone through
the ruins of his body, armed his eye with lightning, and
clothed his lips with thunder." Bodily pain never subdued
the lofty daring, or the extraordinary activity of his mind.
He even used his crutch as a figure of rhetoric. "You
talk, my lords," said he, on one occasion, "of conquering
America&mdash;of your numerous friends there&mdash;and your powerful
forces to disperse her army. I might as well talk of
driving them before me with this crutch."</p>



<h4>CHARLES JAMES FOX.</h4>


<p>Charles James Fox was the third son of Henry Fox, Lord
Holland, and was born January 24th, 1749. His mother
was a daughter of the Duke of Richmond, and his sister
the wife of Lord Cornwallis. Lord Holland made it a rule,
in the tuition of his children, to follow and regulate, but not
to restrain nature. This indulgence was a sad error, as it
always is on the part of parents. On arriving to maturity,
Charles used to boast that he was, when young, never
thwarted in any thing. Two instances are related of this
indulgence of the father, before the son was six years old.
One day, standing by his father, while he was winding up
a watch&mdash;"I have a great mind to break that watch, papa,"
said the boy. "No, Charles; that would be foolish." "Indeed,
papa," said he, "I <i>must</i> do it." "Nay," answered the
father, "if you have such a violent inclination, I won't baulk
it." Upon which, he delivered the watch into the hands of
the youngster, who instantly dashed it on the floor.</p>

<p>At another time, while Lord Holland was secretary of
state, having just finished a long dispatch which he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</a></span>
going to send, Mr. Charles, who stood near him, with his
hand on the inkstand, said, "Papa, I have a good mind to
throw this ink over the paper." "Do, my dear," said the
secretary, "if it will give you any pleasure." The young
gentleman immediately threw on the ink, and his father sat
down very composedly to write the dispatch over again.</p>

<p>Such a course of education, we should anticipate, would
work the moral ruin of a child. Its baleful influence was
seen in after years, in gambling, horse-racing, drinking, and
kindred vices, carried to a fearful extent on the part of this
son, whose training was so inauspiciously begun and
persevered in.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="illus-506.jpg" id="illus-506.jpg"></a>
   <img src="images/illus-506.jpg" alt="Fox." title="Fox."/>
   <p class="caption2">Fox.</p>
</div>

<p>But, despite of these most degrading and ruinous practices,
Fox proved to be one of the most accomplished and
effective orators, and perhaps we may add, statesman of his
times. He was the rival of Pitt; and, though not so finished
in his elocution, he not unfrequently equalled him in the
effect produced.</p>

<p>By what means he attained to such eminence, it scarcely
appears; for the younger part of his life seems to have been
so exclusively devoted to his pleasures, as scarcely to have
time left for the cultivation of his intellect. His genius,
however, was brilliant; and from his earliest years he was
in the society of men distinguished for their cultivated
intellect, and the eminent part they took in the government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</a></span>
of the country. It is related of Fox, that he would not
unfrequently spend the entire night at his favorite amusement,
gambling, and thence proceed to the House of Commons,
when he would electrify the whole assembly with
some cogent and brilliant speech.</p>

<p>Fox was a firm, steadfast friend to the Americans and
their independence. At the time the measures which led
to the American war had come to a crisis, a formidable
party existed in England, opposed to the unjust and illiberal
policy of the government. To this party, Fox united himself;
and, from his conspicuous talents, soon acquired the
authority of a leader. In 1773, he opposed the Boston port
bill, and apologized for the conduct of the colonies. In his
speech on that occasion, he arraigned the measures of the
ministers in bold and energetic language, and explained the
principles of the constitution with masculine eloquence.
The session of 1775, opened with a speech from the king,
declaring the necessity of <i>coercion</i>. On this occasion, Fox
poured forth a torrent of his powerful eloquence. In that
plain, forcible language, which formed one of the many
excellencies of his speeches, he showed what ought to have
been done, what ministers had promised to do, and what
they had not done. He affirmed that Lord Chatham, the
king of Prussia&mdash;nay, even Alexander the Great&mdash;never
gained more in one campaign than Lord North had lost.</p>

<p>When the news of the disastrous defeat of Burgoyne
reached England, Fox loudly insisted upon an inquiry into
the causes of his failure. And in like manner, when the
fate of Cornwallis' army at Yorktown was made known,
the oppositionists were loud in their denunciations of the
proceedings of ministers in regard to the war. Mr. Fox
designed to make a motion for an investigation into the
conduct of Lord Sandwich, who was at the head of the
admiralty. But he was, for a time, too much indisposed to
make the attempt. It was on this occasion, that Burke is
reported to have said, "that if Fox died, it would be no bad
use of his skin, if, like John Ziska's, it should be converted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</a></span>
into a drum, and used for the purpose of sounding an alarm
to the people of England."</p>

<p>The death of Mr. Fox occurred 13th of August, 1806.</p>

<p>Walpole thus compares the two great orators of England:
"Mr. Fox, as a speaker, might be compared to the rough,
but masterly specimen of the sculptor's art; Mr. Pitt, to the
exquisitely finished statue. The former would need a polish
to render him perfect; the latter possessed, in a transcendent
degree, every requisite of an accomplished orator. The
force of Mr. Fox's reasoning flashed like lightning upon
the mind of the hearer: the thunder of Mr. Pitt's eloquence
gave irresistible effect to his powerful and convincing
arguments."</p>

<p>The sympathy and support of such men as Fox, during
our Revolutionary struggle, served to sustain and animate
our patriotic fathers. They felt that while they were in
the field, engaged in defeating the armies of England, they
had friends in the House of Commons, who were making
every possible effort to defeat the impolitic and oppressive
measures of the king and his ministers.</p>



<h4>JOHN STUART.</h4>


<p>John Stuart, Marquis of Bute, was born in 1715. In the
ninth year of his age, he succeeded his father as Marquis
of Bute. On the accession of George the Third, the highest
dignities in the state were supposed to be within the
grasp of Lord Bute; but, however he might have swayed
the king's mind in private, he took no public part in the
direction of public affairs until 1761, when he accepted the
secretaryship resigned in that year by Lord Holderness.
At length, he became prime minister; and, immediately on
coming into power, determined, if possible, to effect a peace,
which had for some time been negotiating. He accomplished
his object, but his success rendered him exceedingly unpopular.
He was accused, by some weak-minded persons, of
having been bribed by the enemies of his country; and it
was added, that the princess dowager had shared with him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</a></span>
in the price at which peace had been purchased by the
French government.</p>

<p>He quitted office in April, 1763, but continued to exert a
powerful influence over the mind of the king, especially in
relation to America. Several measures, the object of which
was to humble the colonies, and continue them in subjection
to the crown, are said to have been suggested by this nobleman.
He died in 1792.</p>



<h4>GEORGE GRENVILLE.</h4>


<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="illus-509.jpg" id="illus-509.jpg"></a>
   <img src="images/illus-509.jpg" alt="Grenville." title="Grenville."/>
   <p class="caption2">Grenville.</p>
</div>

<p>George Grenville was born 1712. In 1741, he was returned
to parliament for the town of Buckingham, for which
place he served during the remainder of his life. He held
several important offices. In April, 1763, he became first
lord of the treasury and chancellor of the exchequer. He
resigned his office in July, 1765, and died in November,
1770. During his premiership, the project of imposing
internal taxes in America was carried into effect. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</a></span>
project was first named to him by the king, and urged upon
him. At first, the minister was opposed to the idea, but
after having adopted it as a measure of his administration,
which he was compelled to do by royal authority, he urged
and supported it by all the means in his power.</p>



<h4>DUKE OF GRAFTON.</h4>


<p>Henry Augustus Fitzroy, Duke of Grafton, was born 1735.
He was educated at Cambridge, where he was notoriously
profligate. In July, 1766, the Rockingham administration
was dissolved, and the Duke of Grafton was made first lord
commissioner of the treasury, which office he held until January,
1770. He has received an unenviable notoriety from
the strictures of Junius. His administration was composed
of men of different political principles and parties. Junius,
in a letter addressed to the duke, thus narrates, and severely
animadverts upon, the circumstances of his grace's appointment
to the premiership: "The spirit of the favorite (Lord
Bute) had some apparent influence upon every administration;
and every set of ministers preserved an appearance
of duration as long as they submitted to that influence; but
there were certain services to be performed for the favorite's
security, or to gratify his resentments, which your predecessors
in office had the wisdom, or the virtue, not to undertake.
A submissive administration was, at last, gradually
collected from the deserters of all parties, interests, and
connexions; and nothing remained but to find a leader for
these gallant, well-disciplined troops. Stand forth, my lord,
for thou art the man! Lord Bute found no resource of
dependence or security in the proud, imposing superiority
of Lord Chatham's abilities; the shrewd, inflexible judgment
of Mr. Grenville; nor in the mild, but determined
integrity of Lord Rockingham. His views and situation
required a creature void of all these properties; and he was
forced to go through all his division, resolution, composition,
and refinement of political chemistry, before he happily
arrived at the <i>caput mortuum</i> of vitriol in your grace. Flat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</a></span>
and insipid in your retired state, but brought into action,
you become vitriol again. Such are the extremes of alternate
indolence or fury, which have governed your whole
administration!"</p>



<h4>FREDERICK NORTH, EARL OF GUILFORD.</h4>


<p>This nobleman, better known as Lord North, was the
minister of George III., under whose administration England
lost her American colonies. He succeeded Charles
Townshend, as chancellor of the exchequer; and, in 1770,
the Duke of Grafton, as first lord of the treasury, and continued
in that high, but laborious office, till the conclusion
of the war. As a public character, Lord North was a
flowing and persuasive orator, well skilled in argumentation,
and master of great presence and coolness of mind;
and, in private life, he was very amiable, cheerful, and
jocose in conversation, the friend of learned men, and correct
in conduct. In his policy towards America, he was
stern and uncompromising. On first coming into power,
he was inclined to be conciliatory; but soon he adopted
restrictive and oppressive measures, more so than his predecessors,
and, at length, declared that he would omit no
means but that he would bring America in humility at his
feet. The faithful warnings of Pitt, Burke, Fox, and
others, had no restraining influence, and the consequence
was, that America was lost to the British crown. Lord
North, in the latter years of his life, was afflicted with
blindness. He died July, 1792, aged sixty.</p>



<h4>BARRASTRE TARLETON.</h4>


<p>Colonel Tarleton was born in Liverpool, on the 21st of
August, 1754, and at first commenced studying law, but, on
the breaking out of war in America, he entered the army,
and, having arrived in that country, he was permitted to
raise a body of troops called the "British Legion," which
he commanded in several successful excursions against the
enemy. Such was the daring intrepidity, energy, and skill,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</a></span>
with which he conducted his corps, that he may be said to
have greatly accelerated, if not secured, some of the most
important victories under Lord Cornwallis. On his return
to England, he was made a colonel, and became so popular
that, in 1790, he was returned, free of expense, as a
member for Liverpool, which he represented in three subsequent
parliaments.</p>

<p>In 1818, previously to which he had been raised to the
rank of general, he was created a baronet, and, on the
coronation of George the Fourth, was made a K. C. B.
He was one of the bravest officers of his time, and is
described as having been to the British, in the American
war, what Arnold, in his early career, was to the
Americans.</p>



<h4>SIR PETER PARKER.</h4>


<p>Sir Peter Parker, son of Rear-admiral Christopher Parker,
was born in 1723, and entered the navy under the
auspices of his father. Having served with great reputation
on several occasions, in 1775 he hoisted his broad
pendant on board the Bristol, of fifty guns, in which he
proceeded, with a squadron under his command, to the
American station. On account of bad weather and other
impediments, he did not reach Cape Fear until May, 1776.
In the following month, he made an unsuccessful attack on
Charleston, in South Carolina. Shortly afterwards, he
joined Lord Howe, the commander-in-chief, at New York,
whence he was dispatched, with the Asia, Renown, and
Preston, to distract the attention of the enemy, while the
army attacked the lines on Long Island. Towards the
close of the same year, he proceeded, in command of a
small squadron, to make an attempt on Rhode Island, of
which he obtained possession without loss. He was now
advanced to the rank of rear-admiral of the blue; and, a
few months after, appointed to the chief command on the
Jamaica station, where he served with signal success until
1782, in which year he returned with a convoy to England.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[Pg 510]</a></span>
Before his death, which occurred in 1811, he became
admiral of the blue and admiral of the white.</p>



<h4>SIR WILLIAM MEADOWS.</h4>


<p>Sir William Meadows was born in 1738. In 1775, he
repaired with his regiment to America, where he distinguished
himself, particularly at the battle of Brandywine,
during which he was wounded.</p>

<p>In 1792, he served under Cornwallis in India. On
returning to England, he was appointed governor of the
Isle of Wight, and, afterwards, governor of Hull. He died
at Bath, 1813.</p>

<p>As a military man, he was highly distinguished. He
was invariably cheerful, during an engagement; and his
troops, by whom he was much beloved, are said, on more
than one occasion, to have mounted the breach, laughing
at their general's last joke. His hilarity scarcely ever
deserted him; one day, while on a reconnoitering party, he
observed a twenty-four-pound shot strike the ground, on his
right, in such a direction that, had he proceeded, it would,
in all probability, have destroyed him; he, therefore, stopped
his horse, and, as the ball dashed across the road in front
of him, gracefully took off his hat, and said: "I beg, sir,
that you will continue your promenade; I never take the
precedence of any gentleman of your family."</p>



<h4>GENERAL GAGE.</h4>


<p>General Thomas Gage, second son of Viscount Gage,
was born about the year 1721, and entered the army at an
early age. Having served with considerable credit, he
was commissioned as lieutenant-general; soon after which,
(April, 1774,) he was appointed to succeed Mr. Hutchinson,
as governor of Massachusetts Bay. In May, he sailed for
Boston with four regiments, where, contrary to his expectations,
he was received with great ceremony and outward
respect.</p>

<p>About this time, serious troubles of the colonies with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[Pg 511]</a></span>
England began. General Gage took strong and decided
measures, and hastened, rather than retarded, an open
contest. By his order it was that the military stores at
Concord were destroyed, which led to the skirmish at
Lexington, and which opened the war.</p>

<p>On the 10th of October, 1775, he resigned his command to
Sir William Howe, and departed for England. At the time
of his death, which took place on the 2d of April, 1788, he
was a general in the army. His talents for command are
said to have been respectable.</p>



<h4>SIR GUY CARLTON.</h4>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="illus-514.jpg" id="illus-514.jpg"></a>
   <img src="images/illus-514.jpg" alt="Sir Guy Carlton." title="Sir Guy Carlton."/>
   <p class="caption2">Sir Guy Carlton.</p>
</div>

<p>Guy Carlton, Lord Dorchester, was born in Ireland, in
1722. In 1748, he became lieutenant-colonel. In 1758, he
served at the siege of Louisburg under Amherst, and the
following year under Wolfe, at the siege of Quebec. Ultimately
he became governor of Quebec, and, during his
administration, defeated the American flotilla under Arnold.
In 1790, having been created Baron Dorchester, he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</a></span>
appointed governor of all the British possessions, except
Newfoundland, in North America. The close of his life
was passed in retirement. He died in 1808. As a soldier,
Lord Dorchester appears to have deservedly obtained a
high reputation for courage and skill.</p>



<h4>MARQUIS OF ROCKINGHAM.</h4>


<p>Charles Watson Wentworth, Marquis of Rockingham,
was born 1730. In 1763, disgusted with the proceedings of
Lord Bute, then the reigning favorite at court, he resigned
the situation of a lord of the bed-chamber, which he had
for some time before held, and also his lord-lieutenancy
of Yorkshire. Two years had scarcely elapsed, however,
when the whole system of government having undergone a
change, he was appointed, in July, 1765, first lord of the
treasury, in the room of George Grenville. He seems to
have brought to his exalted station an anxious desire to
advance the prosperity of his country; and had his talents
been equal to his good intentions, his administration might
have proved fortunate. But the crisis in which he took
office was important and even dangerous, and he had to
struggle against the intrigues of an opposition, powerful
both in numbers and talent. He soon became convinced
of the impracticability of remaining at the helm of affairs,
and resigned the premiership on the 1st of August, 1766.</p>

<p>During the long administration of Lord North, the marquis
was considered, in the House of Lords, as the head of
the aristocratic part of the opposition; but his conduct was
entirely free from that political rancor which has too often
disgraced the parliamentary behavior of the greatest statesmen
in England. At length, Lord North felt compelled to
succumb beneath the force and continued attacks of his
powerful rival, Fox; and George the Third offered the
premiership to Lord Shelburne, who, however, declared
that, in his judgment, no one was so well fitted to take the
lead in administration as the Marquis of Rockingham.
Accordingly, in March, 1782, the marquis was again elevated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</a></span>
to the chief direction of affairs, having for his principal
colleagues, the Earl of Shelburne and Mr. Fox. The
ministry thus formed, seemed likely to be permanent; for it
united much of the wealth and talent of the country. The
hopes of the nation were, however, doomed to be miserably
disappointed. On the 1st of July, the marquis was seized
with a violent spasmodic affection, and almost instantly
expired. He had long anticipated his approaching death,
and is said to have expressed but one motive for wishing a
continuance of life, which was, that he might see his country
extricated from her troubles.</p>



<h4>EDMUND BURKE.</h4>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="illus-516.jpg" id="illus-516.jpg"></a>
   <img src="images/illus-516.jpg" alt="Edmund Burke." title="Edmund Burke."/>
   <p class="caption2">Edmund Burke.</p>
</div>

<p>The history of this distinguished statesman and eloquent
orator is exceedingly interesting, but it belongs to these
pages to notice him only as he was a friend to American
rights, and often lifted up his voice in parliament in defence
of them. He was born in Dublin, 1730. His father was a
respectable attorney. Burke received his education at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</a></span>
Trinity college; on the completion of which, he studied law,
but devoted himself chiefly to literature. He conducted
Dodley's celebrated Annual Register for many years. In
1765, he entered into public life, being made private secretary
to the Marquis of Rockingham at the time that nobleman
was called to the head of the treasury. Soon after,
he was elected to parliament. In 1766, he took a prominent
part in a debate relative to the affairs of America, and
often, afterwards, raised his voice in opposition to the
arbitrary measures of the government. For a time, the
affairs of America are said to have engrossed almost all his
attention.</p>

<p>During one of the debates on American affairs, a member
from Hull, by the name of Hartley, after having driven
four-fifths of a very full house from the benches, by an
unusually dull speech, at length requested that the riot act
might be read, for the purpose of elucidating one of his
propositions. Burke, who was impatient to address the
house himself, immediately started up, and exclaimed: "The
riot act! My dearest friend, why, in the name of every
thing sacred, have the riot act read? The mob, you see, is
already dispersed!" Peals of laughter followed the utterance
of this comic appeal, which Lord North frequently
declared to be one of the happiest instances of wit he
ever heard.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>Burke died in 1797. Unlike many of the statesmen of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[Pg 515]</a></span>
his day, "his character, in private life, was almost unimpeachable."
As a public speaker, his manner was bold
and forcible; his delivery, vehement and unembarrassed;
but, though easy, he was inelegant. His head continually
oscillated, and his gesticulations were frequently violent.
To the last hour of his life, his pronunciation was Hibernian.
Although a great orator, he was not a skillful debater.
Few men ever possessed greater strength of imagination,
or a more admirable choice of words. His mind was
richly stored, and he had the most perfect mastery over its
treasures. Johnson said he was not only the first man in
the House of Commons, but the first man every where; and,
on being asked if he did not think Burke resembled Cicero,
replied, "No, sir; Cicero resembled Burke."</p>



<h4>THADDEUS KOSCIUSKO.</h4>


<p>Thaddeus Kosciusko, a Polish officer in the American
revolutionary war, was born in Lithuania, in 1756, of an
ancient and noble family, and educated at the military
school at Warsaw. He afterwards studied in France.
He came to America, recommended, by Franklin, to General
Washington, by whom he was appointed his aid. He
was also appointed his engineer, with the rank of colonel,
in October 1776. At the unsuccessful siege of Ninety-Six,
in 1781, he very judiciously directed the operations. It
was, in 1774, that he left this country, and, in 1786, he
returned to Poland. In 1789, the diet gave him the
appointment of major-general. In the campaign of 1792,
he distinguished himself against the Russians. In 1794,
the Poles again took arms, and were headed by Kosciusko;
but, after several splendid battles, he was taken and thrown
into prison by Catharine, but was released by Paul I.
When the emperor presented him with his own sword, he
declined it, saying: "I no longer need a sword, since I
have no longer a country." Never afterwards did he wear
a sword. In August, 1797, he visited America, and was
received with honor. For his revolutionary services, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</a></span>
received a pension. In 1798, he went to France. Having
purchased an estate near Fontainebleau, he lived there till
1814. In 1816, he settled at Soleure, in Switzerland. In
1817, he abolished slavery on his estate in Poland. He
died at Soleure, in consequence of a fall with his horse from
a precipice near Vevay, October 16, 1817, aged sixty-one.
He was never married.</p>



<h4>COUNT PULASKI.</h4>


<p>Count Pulaski was a Polander by birth, who, with a few
men, in 1771, carried off King Stanislaus from the middle
of his capital, though surrounded with a numerous body of
guards and a Russian army. The king soon escaped, and
declared Pulaski an outlaw. After his arrival in this country,
he offered his services to congress, and was honored
with the rank of brigadier-general. He discovered the
greatest intrepidity in an engagement with a party of the
British near Charleston, in May, 1779. In the assault upon
Savannah, October 9th, by General Lincoln and Count
D'Estaing, Pulaski was wounded, at the head of two hundred
horsemen, as he was galloping into the town, with the
intention of charging in the rear. He died on the 11th,
and congress resolved that a monument should be erected
to his memory.</p>



<h4>BARON DE KALB.</h4>


<p>Baron de Kalb was a native of Germany, but had been
long employed in the service of France, previous to the
commencement of the American revolution. He arrived
in this country in 1777; and being an officer of great experience,
he early received from congress the commission of
major-general. In the battle near Camden, August, 1780,
he fell, after receiving eleven wounds, in his vigorous exertions
to prevent the defeat of the Americans. He died
August 19th, aged forty-seven, having served three years
with high reputation. His last moments were spent in dictating
a letter, which expressed his warm affection for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[Pg 517]</a></span>
men and officers of his division, and his admiration of their
firmness and courage in withstanding a superior force. An
ornamental tree was planted at the head of his grave in
the neighborhood of Camden, and congress resolved that a
monument should be erected to his memory at Annapolis,
with a very honorable inscription.</p>



<h4>BARON STEUBEN.</h4>


<p>Frederick William, Baron de Steuben, was a Prussian
officer, aid-de-camp to Frederick the Great, and lieutenant-general
in the army of that distinguished commander. He
arrived in America in 1777; soon after which, he was made
inspector-general, with the rank of major-general. He
established a uniform system of man&#339;uvres; and, by his
skill and persevering industry, effected, during the continuance
of the troops at Valley Forge, a most decided improvement
in all ranks of the army. He was a volunteer in the
action at Monmouth, and commanded in the trenches at
Yorktown on the day which concluded the struggle with
Great Britain. He died at Steubenville, New York, November
28th, 1794, aged sixty-one years.</p>

<p>"When the army was disbanded, and the old soldiers
shook hands in farewell, Lieutenant-colonel Cochran, a
Green-mountain veteran, said: 'For myself, I could stand it;
but my wife and daughters are in the garret of that wretched
tavern, and I have no means of removing them,' 'Come,'
said the baron, 'I will pay my respects to Mrs. C. and her
daughters.' And when he left them, their countenances
were brightened; for he gave them all he had to give.
This was at Newburg. On the wharf, he saw a poor
wounded black man, who wanted a dollar to pay for his
passage home. Of whom the baron borrowed the dollar,
it is not known; but he soon returned; when the negro
hailed the sloop, and cried: 'God bless you, master baron!'
The state of New Jersey gave him a small farm. New
York gave him sixteen thousand acres in Oneida county; a
pension of twenty-five hundred dollars was also given him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</a></span>
He built him a log house at Steubenville, gave a tenth-part
of his land to his aids and servants, and parceled out the
rest to twenty or thirty tenants. His library was his chief
solace. Having but little exercise, he died of apoplexy.
Agreeably to his request, he was wrapped in his cloak, and
buried in a plain coffin, without a stone. He was a believer
in Jesus Christ, and a member of the Reformed Dutch
Church, New York."</p>



<h4>COUNT ROCHAMBEAU.</h4>


<p>Jean Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, Comte de Rochambeau,
marshal of France, was born at Vendome in 1725.
At the age of sixteen he entered the army, and served in
Germany, under Marshal Broglio. In 1746, he became aid
to Louis Philip, Duke of Orleans. In 1780, having been
made lieutenant-general, he was sent with an army of six
thousand men to the assistance of the United States of
America. On reaching the place of his destination, he
landed in Rhode Island, and soon after acted in concert
with Washington, first against Clinton in New York, and
then against Cornwallis, rendering important services at the
siege of Yorktown, which were rewarded by a present of
two cannon taken from Lord Cornwallis. After the Revolution,
Rochambeau was raised to the rank of a marshal by
Louis XVI., and received the command of the army of the
north. He was soon superseded by more active officers,
and being calumniated by the popular journalists, he
addressed to the legislative assembly a vindication of his
conduct. A decree of approbation was consequently passed
in May, 1792, and he retired to his estate near Vendome,
with a determination to interfere no more with public affairs.
He was subsequently arrested, and narrowly escaped suffering
death under the tyranny of Robespiere. In 1803, he
was presented to Buonaparte, who in the following year
gave him a pension and the cross of grand officer of the
legion of honor. His death took place in 1809.&mdash;<i>Encyclopedia
Americana</i>.</p>

<h4>COUNT D'ESTAING.</h4>


<p>Charles Henry, Count d'Estaing, admiral and lieutenant-general
of the armies of France, before the Revolution, was
a native of Ravel, in Auvergne, and was descended from
an ancient family in that province. Count d'Estaing commenced
his career by serving in the East Indies, under
Lally, when he was taken prisoner, and sent home on his
parole. Having engaged in hostilities again before he was
regularly exchanged, he was taken a second time, and
imprisoned at Portsmouth. During the American war, he
was employed as vice-admiral.</p>

<p>At the capture of the isle of Grenada, he distinguished
himself; but on every occasion he showed more courage
than conduct or professional skill. He promoted the Revolution,
and in 1789, he was appointed a commander of the
National Guards at Versailles. In 1791, he addressed to
the national assembly a letter full of protestations of attachment
to the constitution, on the occasion of the approaching
trial of the king. He suffered under the guillotine in 1793,
as a counter-revolutionist, at the age of sixty-five.</p>

<p>The several colonies established in America had governments
which varied according as they were charter, proprietary,
or royal, which were the three forms of government
existing in America prior to the Revolution. In certain
particulars, they differed from each other as classes, and the
classes differed as individuals. But for a series of years
there existed no general political association, or bond of
union among them. As early, however, as 1643, the New
England colonies, Massachusetts, Plymouth, Connecticut,
and New Haven, entered into a perpetual alliance, offensive
and defensive, for mutual protection against the claims of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[Pg 521]</a></span>
their Dutch neighbors, and the assaults of their Indian foes.
By the articles of this confederation, the jurisdiction of each
colony within its own borders was to be exclusive; on the
occurrence of war, each one was to furnish its quota of men
and provisions, according to its population; and two commissioners
from each colony were to hold an annual meeting
to decide on all matters of general interest. With some
alterations, this confederacy existed more than forty years;
it was dissolved only in 1686, when the charters of the New
England colonies were vacated by a commissioner from
James II. This union was productive of many advantages
to the colonies. Besides preserving a mutual good understanding
among them, and thus preventing encroachments
upon one another's rights, assistance was rendered in their
wars with the Indians; without which, it is probable that
the more feeble would have been broken up.</p>

<p>In 1754, an attempt at union was made on a more extensive
scale. The plan originated in a call from the lords
commissioners for trade and the plantations, and consisted
of deputies from the New England provinces, New York,
Pennsylvania, and Maryland. The congress met at Albany.
The object proposed by the commissioners was to consider
the best means of defence in case of a war with France,
and particularly to form an alliance with the Six Nations.
Governor Shirley, of Massachusetts, availing himself of the
occasion, proposed to the several governors that the delegates
should be instructed on the subject of a <i>general union</i>
or <i>confederation</i>. This meeting with general approbation,
the delegates were so instructed. A plan of union, prepared
by Dr. Franklin, was discussed, and substantially adopted&mdash;the
delegates from Connecticut dissenting.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> But it received
the approbation neither of the colonies nor of the king's
council; not by the first, because it was supposed to give
too much power to the president-general, who was to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[Pg 522]</a></span>
the king's representative; nor by the latter, because too
much power was supposed to be given to the representatives
of the people.</p>

<p>The foregoing plan having failed, no other attempt at
union was made for several years. At length, in 1765,
in consequence of the passing of the stamp act by parliament,
and other grievances, the assembly of Massachusetts
in June of that year adopted the following resolution:
"That it is highly expedient there should be a meeting, as
soon as may be, of committees from the houses of representatives
or burgesses, in the several colonies, to consult
on the present circumstances of the colonies, and the difficulties
to which they are and must be reduced, and to consider
of a general congress, to be held at New York, the
first Tuesday of October. A letter was prepared, to be
sent to the several speakers, and a committee was chosen
for Massachusetts."</p>

<p>In consequence of the proceedings under this recommendation,
"on the 7th of October, a congress, consisting
of twenty-eight delegates from the assemblies of Massachusetts,
Rhode Island and Providence Plantations,
Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, the
Delaware counties, Maryland, and South Carolina, convened
in the city of New York, and Timothy Ruggles, of
Massachusetts, was chosen president. The first measure
of the congress was a declaration of the rights and grievances
of the colonists. They were declared to be entitled
to all the rights and liberties of natural-born subjects within
the kingdom of Great Britain; among the most essential of
which are, the exclusive power to tax themselves, and the
privileges of a trial by jury. The grievance chiefly complained
of was the act granting certain stamp duties and
other duties in the British colonies, which, by taxing the
colonies without their consent, and by extending the jurisdiction
of courts of admiralty, was declared to have a
direct tendency to subvert their rights and liberties. A
petition to the king, and a memorial to each house of parliament,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[Pg 523]</a></span>
were also agreed on; and it was recommended to
the several colonies to appoint special agents, who should
unite their utmost endeavors in soliciting redress of grievances.
The assemblies of Virginia, North Carolina, and
Georgia, were prevented, by their governors, from sending
representatives to the congress; but they forwarded
petitions to England, similar to those appointed by
that body."<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>In 1774, the grievances of the colonies still continuing,
and having been increased by the open assertion of Great
Britain of the justice of her pretensions, another congress
was assembled at Philadelphia, which consisted of delegates
from eleven colonies. In this congress, each colony
had one vote. Their principal acts consisted of a declaration
of rights, and in spirited addresses to the people of
British America and Great Britain, together with a recommendation
to the colonies to adopt resolutions of non-importation,
non-exportation, and non-consumption.</p>

<p>The resolutions of this congress received the general
sanction of the provincial congress and of the colonial
assemblies. Their power was merely advisory; "yet their
recommendations," says Dr. Holmes, "were more generally
and more effectually carried into execution by the colonies
than the laws of the best-regulated state."</p>

<p>But the dissuasive measures adopted by this congress
having no effect on the king and his ministers, another congress
followed in 1775, "whose pacific efforts to bring about
a change in the views of the other party being equally
unavailing, and the commencement of actual hostilities
having, at length, put an end to all hope of reconciliation,
the congress finding, moreover, that the popular voice
began to call for an entire and perpetual dissolution of the
political ties which had connected them with Great Britain,
proceeded on the memorable 4th of July, 1776, to declare
the thirteen colonies <i>independent states</i>.</p>

<p>"During the discussions of this solemn act, a committee,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[Pg 524]</a></span>
consisting of a member from each colony, had been
appointed to prepare and digest a form of confederation for
the future management of the common interest, which had,
hitherto, been left to the discretion of congress, guided by
the exigencies of the contest, and by the known intentions,
or occasional instructions of the colonial legislatures.</p>

<p>"It appears that as early as the 21st of July, 1775, a
plan, entitled 'Articles of Confederation and <i>perpetual</i>
union of the Colonies,' had been sketched by Dr. Franklin,
the plan being on that day submitted by him to congress;
and though not copied into their journals, remaining on their
files in his hand-writing. But, notwithstanding the term
'perpetual,' observed in the title, the articles provided
expressly for the event of a return of the colonies to a
connection with Great Britain.</p>

<p>"This sketch became a basis for the plan reported by the
committee on the 12th of July, now also remaining on the
files of congress, in the hand-writing of Mr. Dickinson.
The plan, though dated after the Declaration of Independence,
was probably drawn up before that event; since
the name of colonies, not states, is used throughout the
draught. The plan reported was debated and amended
from time to time, till the 17th of November, 1777, when it
was agreed to by congress, and proposed to the legislatures
of the states, with an explanatory and recommendatory
letter. The ratifications of these, by their delegates
in congress, duly authorized, took place at successive
dates; but were not completed till the 1st of March, 1781;
when Maryland, who had made it a prërequisite that the
vacant lands acquired from the British crown should be a
common fund, yielded to the persuasion that a final and
formal establishment of the federal union and government
would make a favorable impression, not only on other foreign
nations, but on Great Britain herself."<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>Under this confederation, the country went through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[Pg 525]</a></span>
war. Fortunate it was, however, that the war terminated
when it did, as the "rope of sand," as the confederation
was called, would probably have served as a bond of union
but a few years longer. Indeed, it had received the cordial
approbation of none of the colonies&mdash;while some of
them had, at length, acceded to it rather from necessity
than choice.</p>

<p>"The principal difficulties which embarrassed the progress
and retarded the completion of the plan of confederation,"
says Mr. Madison, "may be traced to&mdash;first, the
natural repugnance of the parties to a relinquishment of
power; secondly, a natural jealousy of its abuse in other
than hands their own; thirdly, the rule of suffrage among
parties whose inequality in size did not correspond with that
of their wealth, or of their military or free population;
fourthly, the selection and definition of the powers, at once
necessary to the federal head, and safe to the several
members.</p>

<p>"To these sources of difficulty, incident to the formation
of all such confederacies, were added two others, one of a
temporary, the other of a permanent nature. The first,
was the case of the crown-lands, so called, because they
had been held by the British crown; and being ungranted
to individuals, when its authority ceased, were considered
by the states within whose charters or asserted limits they
lay, as devolving on them; while it was contended by the
others, that, being wrested from the dethroned authority by
the equal exertions of all, they resulted of right and in
equity to the benefit of all. The lands, being of vast
extent, and of growing value, were the occasion of much
discussion and heart-burning, and proved the most obstinate
of the impediments to an earlier consummation of the plan
of the federal government. The state of Maryland, the
last that acceded to it, firmly withheld her assent, till the
1st of March, 1781; and then yielded only in the hope that,
by giving a stable and authoritative character to the confederation,
a successful termination of the contest might be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[Pg 526]</a></span>
accelerated. The dispute was happily compromised, by
successive surrenders of portions of the territory by the
states having exclusive claims to it, and acceptances of
them by congress.</p>

<p>"The other source of dissatisfaction was the peculiar
situation of some of the states, which, having no convenient
ports for foreign commerce, were subject to be taxed by
their neighbors, through whose ports their commerce was
carried on. New Jersey, placed between Philadelphia and
New York, was likened to a cask tapped at both ends;
and North Carolina, between Virginia and South Carolina,
to a patient bleeding at both arms. The Articles of Confederation
provided no remedy for the complaint; which
produced a strong protest on the part of New Jersey, and
never ceased to be a source of discord, until the new constitution
superseded the old.</p>

<p>"But the radical infirmity of the Articles of Confederation
was the dependence of congress on the voluntary and
simultaneous compliance with its requisitions by so many
independent communities, each consulting, more or less, its
particular interests and convenience, and distrusting the
compliance of the others. While the paper emissions of
congress continued to circulate, they were employed as a
sinew of war, like gold and silver. When that ceased to
be the case, and the fatal defect of the political system was
felt in its alarming force, the war was merely kept alive,
and brought to a successful conclusion, by such foreign aids
and temporary expedients as could be applied; a hope
prevailing with many, and a wish with all, that a state of
peace, and the sources of prosperity opened by it, would
give to the confederacy, in practice, the efficiency which
had been inferred in theory."</p>

<p>The close of the war brought no adequate relief. The
wealth of the country was exhausted. Congress had no
funds, and no means of raising money for the discharge of
arrears of pay due to the soldiers of the Revolution, but by
an appeal to the legislative assemblies of the several states.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[Pg 527]</a></span>
Even for their own maintenance, they were dependent
upon the assemblies. The legislatures themselves often
knew not what to do.</p>

<p>"The distress of the inhabitants was continually on the
increase; and in Massachusetts, where it was most felt, an
insurrection of a serious character was the consequence.
Near the close of the year 1786, the populace assembled, to
the number of two thousand, in the north-western part of
the state, and, choosing Daniel Shays their leader, demanded
that the collection of debts should be suspended, and that
the legislature should authorize the emission of paper
money for general circulation. Two bodies of militia,
drawn from those parts where dissatisfaction did not prevail,
were immediately dispatched against them, one under
command of General Lincoln, the other of General Shepard.
The disaffected were dispersed with less difficulty
than had been apprehended, and, abandoning their seditious
purposes, adopted the proffered indemnity of the
government.</p>

<p>"The time, at length, came, when the public mind gave
tokens of being prepared for a change in the constitution
of the general government&mdash;an occurrence, the necessity
of which had long been foreseen by Washington and most
of the distinguished patriots of that period. Evil had
accumulated upon evil, till the mass became too oppressive
to be endured, and the voice of the nation cried out
for relief. The first decisive measures proceeded from
the merchants, who came forward almost simultaneously in
all parts of the country, with representations of the utter
prostration of the mercantile interests, and petitions for a
speedy and efficient remedy. It was shown, that the
advantages of this most important source of national prosperity
were flowing into the hands of foreigners, and that
the native merchants were suffering for the want of a just
protection and a uniform system of trade. The wise and
reflecting were convinced that some decided efforts were
necessary to strengthen the general government, or that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[Pg 528]</a></span>
dissolution of the union, and perhaps a devastating anarchy,
would be inevitable."<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>The first step, which led to the convention of 1787, was
taken by Virginia, in a proposition of her legislature, in
January, 1786, for a convention of delegates to establish
such a system of commercial relations as would promote
general harmony and prosperity. The above proposal
was cordially approved by Delaware, Pennsylvania, New
Jersey, and New York, and delegates were accordingly
appointed by them, in addition to Virginia. These convened
at Annapolis, September, 1786; but they had scarcely
entered into a discussion of topics, which naturally forced
themselves into view, before they discovered the powers
with which they were intrusted to be so limited, as to tie
up their hands from effecting any purpose that could be of
essential utility. On this account, as well as from the
circumstance that so few states were represented, they
wisely declined deciding on any important measures in
reference to the particular subject for which they had come
together. This convention is memorable, however, as
having been the prelude to the one which followed.
Before the commissioners adjourned, a report was agreed
upon, in which the necessity of a revision and reform of the
articles of the old federal compact was strongly urged, and
which contained a recommendation to all the state legislatures
"for the appointment of deputies, to meet at Philadelphia,
with more ample powers and instructions." This
report was sent to congress, as well as to the several states.</p>

<p>In the appointment of delegates, agreeably to the foregoing
recommendation, Virginia took the lead. February,
1787, the subject claimed the attention of congress, and
the following preamble and resolution were adopted:</p>

<p>"Whereas, there is provision, in the articles of confederation
and perpetual union, for making alterations therein,
by the assent of a congress of the United States, and of
the legislatures of the several states; and whereas experience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[Pg 529]</a></span>
hath evinced that there are defects in the present
confederation, as a means to remedy which, several of the
states, and particularly the state of New York, by express
instruction to their delegates in congress, have suggested a
convention for the purpose expressed in the following resolution,
and such convention appearing to be the most probable
means of establishing in these states a firm national
government&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Resolved</i>, That, in the opinion of congress, it is expedient,
that, on the second Monday in May next, a convention
of delegates, who shall have been appointed by the
several states, be held at Philadelphia, for the sole and
express purpose of revising the articles of confederation,
and reporting to congress and the several legislatures such
alterations and provisions therein, as shall, when agreed to
in congress, and confirmed by the states, render the federal
constitution adequate to the exigencies of government, and
the preservation of the union."</p>

<p>In consequence of this recommendation, all the states
appointed delegates to the convention, excepting Rhode
Island.</p>

<p>On the day fixed for the meeting of the deputies in convention,
Monday, May 14th, 1787, a small number only had
assembled. May 25th, seven states were represented.
The deputation from Pennsylvania, proposed George
Washington, Esq., late commander-in-chief, for president
of the convention,<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> and he was unanimously elected.</p>

<p>Tuesday, March 29th, the convention entered upon the
solemn duties of their commission. A question of serious
magnitude early engrossed their attention, viz: whether
they should amend the old system, or form a new one. For
the former object, they had been appointed, congress having
limited their power to a revision of the articles of the confederation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[Pg 530]</a></span>
But the defects of the old system were so
many, and of such magnitude, that, at the session of the
convention the above day, Edmund Randolph, of Virginia,
submitted fifteen resolutions, as the basis of a new constitution.
These resolutions, denominated the <i>Virginia plan</i>,
were debated and amended until the 15th of June, when
Mr. Patterson, of New Jersey, presented a project for
revising the articles of confederation. This was called the
<i>Jersey plan</i>,<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> and, on motion of Mr. Patterson, was taken
up&mdash;the Virginia plan, meanwhile, being postponed.</p>

<p>On the 18th, Mr. Dickinson moved, in committee of the
whole, to "postpone the first resolution in Mr. Patterson's
plan, in order to take up the following, viz: 'that the Articles
of Confederation ought to be revised and amended, so as to
render the government of the United States adequate to the
exigencies, the preservation, and the prosperity of the union'&mdash;the
postponement was agreed to by ten states; Pennsylvania,
divided." The following day, this substitute was
rejected by a vote of six states to four, and one divided.
Mr. Patterson's plan was again at large before the committee.
Towards the close of the session of the same day, the
question was taken upon postponing this latter plan, and
carried by a vote of seven states to three, and one divided.
Mr. Randolph's, or the Virginia plan, came again under consideration.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[Pg 531]</a></span>
This was now further discussed to the 23d of
June, when, on motion of Mr. Gerry, the proceedings of the
convention for the establishment of a national government,
except the part relating to an executive, were referred to a
committee, to prepare and report a constitution conformable
thereto. This committee consisted of Mr. Rutledge, Mr.
Randolph, Mr. Gorham, Mr. Ellsworth, and Mr. Wilson.
"On the 26th of the same month, those relating to the executive
having been adopted, they, with various other propositions
submitted by individuals, were referred to the same
committee, and the committee adjourned to the 6th of August,
when the committee reported a draft of a constitution. This
was under debate until the 9th of September, and underwent
many material alterations. A committee, consisting of Mr.
Johnson, Mr. Hamilton, G. Morris, Mr. Madison, and Mr.
King, was then selected 'to revise the style and arrange
the articles.' The manner in which these eminent scholars
and statesmen performed the duty assigned them, appears
from the great precision and accuracy of the language of
the constitution, as well as the happy arrangement of its
various articles."</p>

<p>The report of this committee was made on the 12th of
September, and further debated till the 16th, when the constitution
as amended was agreed to by all states, and
ordered to be engrossed.</p>

<p>On the following day, September 17th, after the reading
of the constitution as engrossed, the venerable Franklin rose,
and putting a written speech into the hands of Mr. Wilson,
requested him to read it:</p>

<p>"<i>Mr. President</i>: I confess that there are several parts of
this constitution which I do not at present approve, but I am
not sure I shall never approve them; for having lived long,
I have experienced many instances of being obliged by
better information, or fuller consideration, to change opinions
even on important subjects, which I once thought right, but
found to be otherwise. It is therefore that, the older I grow,
the more apt I am to doubt my own judgment, and to pay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[Pg 532]</a></span>
more respect to the judgment of others. Most men, indeed,
as well as most sects in religion, think themselves in possession
of all truth, and that wherever others differ from them,
it is so far error. Steele, a protestant, in a dedication, tells
the pope, that the only difference between our churches, in
their opinions of the certainty of their doctrines, is, 'the
church of Rome is infallible, and the church of England is
never in the wrong.' But though many private persons
think almost as highly of their own infallibility as of that of
their sect, few express it so naturally as a certain French
lady, who, in a dispute with her sister, said, 'I don't know
how it happens, sister, but I meet with nobody but myself
that is always in the right.'</p>

<p>"In these sentiments, sir, I agree to this constitution, with
all its faults, if they are such, because I think a general
government necessary for us, and there is no form of government
but what may be a blessing to the people, if well
administered; and I believe further, that this is likely to be
well administered for a course of years, and can only end
in despotism, as other forms have done before it, when the
people shall become so corrupted as to need despotic government,
being incapable of any other. I doubt, too, whether
any other convention we can obtain, may be able to make
a better constitution. For when you assemble a number of
men, to have the advantage of their joint wisdom, you inevitably
assemble, with those men, all their prejudices, their
passions, their errors of opinion, their local interests, and
their selfish views. From such an assembly, can a perfect
production be expected? It therefore astonishes me, sir, to
find this system approaching so near to perfection as it does;
and I think it will astonish our enemies, who are waiting with
confidence to hear that our councils are confounded, like
those of the builders of Babel; and that our states are on
the point of separation, only to meet hereafter for the purpose
of cutting one another's throats. Thus I consent, sir,
to this constitution, because I expect no better, and because
I am not sure that it is not the best. The opinions I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[Pg 533]</a></span>
had of its errors, I sacrifice to the public good. I have
never whispered a syllable of them abroad. Within these
walls they were born, and here they shall die. If every
one of us, in returning to our constituents, were to report
the objections he has had to it, and endeavor to gain
partisans in support of them, we might prevent its being
generally received, and thereby lose all its salutary effects
and great advantages, resulting naturally in our favor among
foreign nations, as well as among ourselves, from our real or
apparent unanimity. Much of the strength and efficiency
of any government in procuring and securing happiness to
the people, depends on opinion&mdash;on the general opinion of
the goodness of the government, as well as of the wisdom
and integrity of its governors. I hope, therefore, that for
our own sakes, as a part of the people, and for the sake of
posterity, we shall act heartily and unanimously in recommending
this constitution (if approved by congress and confirmed
by the conventions) wherever our influence may
extend, and turn our future thoughts and endeavors to the
means of having it well administered.</p>

<p>"On the whole, sir, I cannot help expressing a wish that
every member of the convention, who may still have objections
to it, would with me, on this occasion, doubt a little of
his own infallibility, and to make manifest our unanimity,
put his name to this instrument." He then moved that the
constitution be signed by the members, and offered the following
as a convenient form, viz: "Done in convention, by
the unanimous consent of the <i>states</i> present, the 17th of
September, &amp;c. In witness whereof, we have hereunto
subscribed our names."</p>

<p>The motion of Dr. Franklin to sign by <i>states</i> was objected
to by several of the members, but was agreed to&mdash;all the
<i>states</i> answering "<i>ay</i>."</p>

<p>While the last members were signing their names, Dr.
Franklin, looking towards the president's chair, at the back
of which a rising sun happened to be painted, observed to
a few members near him, that painters had found it difficult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[Pg 534]</a></span>
to distinguish, in their art, a rising from a setting sun. I
have, said he, often and often, in the course of the session,
and the vicissitudes of my hopes and fears as to its issue,
looked at that behind the president, without being able to
tell whether it was rising or setting; but now, at length, I
have the happiness to know that it is a rising, and not a
setting sun.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

   <p class="caption2">Franklin.</p>
</div>

<p>During the deliberations of the convention, several
questions of deep interest arose; but none, perhaps, more
exciting than that which related to the relative weight of
the states in the two branches of the national legislature.
The small states, at length, consented that the right of suffrage
in the house should be in proportion to the whole
number of white or other free citizens in each, including
those bound to service for a term of years, and three-fifths
of all other persons. While they yielded this point, they
insisted on an equal vote in the senate.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[Pg 535]</a></span></p>
<p>To this, the larger states objected; and, on this question,
they remained for a time about equally divided. "On the
first trial, in committee of the whole, six states against five
decided that the right of suffrage in the senate should be
the same as in the house; the states of Massachusetts,
Pennsylvania, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina,
and Georgia, being in the affirmative, and Connecticut,
New York, New Jersey, Delaware, and Maryland in the
negative.</p>

<p>"On the 29th of June, the question was again presented
to the consideration of the convention, in a motion made
by Mr. Ellsworth, "that in the second branch, each state
should have an equal vote." We cannot pretend to give
even an outline of the arguments in favor and against this
motion. The debate was warm and exciting. For several
days, the powers of mighty minds were in animated collision;
and from the strong ramparts behind which the
respective parties had apparently entrenched themselves,
there was, for a time, little prospect of union on the question.</p>

<p>"On the 23d of July, the question was taken, on the
motion of Mr. Ellsworth, that in the senate each state
should have one vote; and five states were in favor of it,
five against it, and one divided; and the motion was lost.
This equal division on a subject of such importance, accompanied
with so much warmth on both sides, seemed to
present an insurmountable obstacle to further proceedings
of the convention, without some compromise. To effect
this, Charles C. Pinckney, of South Carolina, moved for the
appointment of a committee, to take into consideration the
subject of both branches of the legislature. This motion
prevailed, though not without opposition. Some of the
members were in favor of appointing a committee, though
they had little expectation of a favorable result. Mr. Martin,
of Maryland, declared that each state must have an
equal vote, or the business of the convention was at an end.</p>

<p>"Mr. Sherman said, we have got to a point that we cannot
move one way or the other; a committee is necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[Pg 536]</a></span>
to set us right. Mr. Gerry observed, that the world
expected something from them: if we do nothing, we
must have war and confusion&mdash;the old confederation would
be at an end. Let us see if concessions cannot be made&mdash;accommodation
is absolutely necessary, and defects may be
amended by a future convention.</p>

<p>"Thus the convention was at a stand. Hopes were
indeed entertained that unanimity of views might on some
basis prevail; but the longer continuance of the debate, in
the then existing state of the convention, it was apparent,
was engendering no good."</p>

<p>Fully sensible that nothing could be effected but upon a
principle of compromise, the convention proceeded to elect,
by ballot, a committee<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> of one from each state, to report on
this exciting subject, and adjourned for three days. The
interval was one of great anxiety; neither party appeared
inclined to recede from the position it had taken, and the
great objects for which the convention had assembled
were apparently to be lost. And who could foresee the
result? But at this most critical juncture, God did not forsake
the nation. He had borne her forward, and now his
spirit was felt in his becalming influence upon the convention.
On rëassembling, the above committee made a report,
which being accepted, the deliberations of the convention
proceeded with greater unanimity, until, at length, a constitution
was agreed upon.</p>

<p>The convention recommended that the constitution should
be submitted to state conventions, and that as soon as the
same should have been ratified by a constitutional majority,
congress should take measures for the election of a president,
and fix the time for commencing proceedings under
it. Among the states, great diversity of opinion prevailed
respecting this constitution; and, for a time, it was doubtful
whether it would receive the approbation of a majority.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[Pg 537]</a></span>
But, at length, not only this number was obtained, but all
gave their assent, and in the following order:</p>

<p>"At the first session of the first congress, the senate and
house of representatives, two-thirds concurring, recommended
to the states the adoption of twelve amendments
to the constitution, chiefly relating to the freedom of speech
and of the press&mdash;the right of petition&mdash;trial by jury&mdash;bail&mdash;election
of president, &amp;c. Ten of these amendments
were adopted by three-fourths of the legislatures of the
states, and became a part of the constitution. Subsequently,
two other amendments were added."</p>

<p>"The peaceable adoption of this government," says
Chancellor Kent, "under all the circumstances which
attended it, presented the case of an effort of deliberation,
combined with a spirit of amity and mutual concession,
which was without example. It must be a source of just
pride, and of the most grateful recollection to every American
who reflects seriously on the difficulty of the experiment,
the manner in which it was conducted, the felicity of
its issue, and the fate of similar trials in other nations of
the earth."</p>

<p>The opinions which prevailed in the convention of 1787,
as to the addition of new states, are worthy of notice. On
one occasion, Mr. Sherman said, "there is no probability
that the number of future states will exceed that of the
existing states. If the event should ever happen, it is too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[Pg 538]</a></span>
remote to be taken into consideration at this time." But
little more than half a century has elapsed, and the original
number has more than doubled, as may be seen by the following
account of the states admitted:</p>

<p>The constitution, of the formation and adoption of which
we have thus given an account, has been in existence more
than sixty years. Meanwhile, what changes in empires
and governments have been effected in other portions of
the globe! Monarchs have been hurled from their thrones&mdash;or
have waged war, and expended millions to retain
them. Their subjects, degraded and oppressed, have
sighed and struggled for liberty, but only to find the chains
of servitude drawn more closely around them. Not until
recently, have the nations of Europe seemed to realize that
an improvement in their political condition was possible.
They are, indeed, just now making an effort to throw off
the yoke and fetters; but what will be the result of their
experiments, no sagacity can well foresee.</p>

<p>The American people may well congratulate themselves
upon the realization of so many of their early hopes. God
has helped them; and never should his kind and protecting
care be overlooked; nor his interpositions in days of darkness
and perplexity be forgotten. That was a glorious
struggle, through which they passed, and which resulted in
their emancipation from British oppression. But I know
not whether the intervening hand of Providence was more
conspicuous in that contest, than in leading our statesmen
to the formation of the constitution, or so many independent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[Pg 539]</a></span>
states, whose interests were apparently so conflictive, or
whose minds were so diverse, to its unanimous adoption.</p>

<p>And why has it lasted? Why have we not presented
to the world, the same feverish and changeful disposition,
which has characterized our sister republics of the South?
Not one of the latter, scarcely, has passed a single ten years,
without intestine commotions&mdash;or some change of their
constitutions&mdash;or some radical alteration of their political
principles. And their people&mdash;what portions of them have
dwelt securely&mdash;or experienced a moiety of the advantages
and prosperity that have blessed this Northern confederacy?</p>

<p>The constitution of the United States has been, and is,
the wonder and admiration of the civilized world. How is
such a national sovereignty as that constitution contemplates
and creates, compatible with so many independent state
sovereignties! Who could imagine that there could exist
such efficiency in the one, and yet such harmony among
the others! To the friends of monarchy, the mystery is
nearly inexplicable; and it seems quite impossible for the
statesmen of other countries, however desirous they may
be, so to understand the theory and practice of our national
and state governments, as to conform them to the circumstances
of any other people on the globe.</p>

<p>If it be inquired how the framers of our constitution should
have devised such a government, and shaped it to meet the
wants of a people in some respects one, and in other respects
so diverse, the most intelligent and truthful answer is&mdash;God
superintended and guided them; not by immediate inspiration,
but they served a long training; from the very settlement
of the country, and in the circumstances which led
our fathers to these shores, there was a work of preparation.
And when the time came, there was the patriotism&mdash;the
self-denial&mdash;the intelligence&mdash;the political wisdom&mdash;which
were necessary to devise and perfect our glorious
constitution.</p>

<p>But will it last?&mdash;Last! Should an American citizen ever
indulge a thought to the contrary? But such thoughts will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[Pg 540]</a></span>
crowd in, and cause anxiety to the patriot. When he looks
over the pages of past history, and reads the rise and fall of
ancient republics&mdash;and by what means they perished&mdash;by
their own hands&mdash;and by means of their prosperity&mdash;and
then casts his eyes over his own country, and witnesses the
thrift, the wealth, the expanding strength and glory of that
country&mdash;he will ask, will our constitution stand?&mdash;will it
continue to unite a people separated into so many and so
distant states? Especially will he have reason for solicitude
and doubt, when he dwells upon the great and grave
questions which are rising up, and are dividing the North
and the South&mdash;the East and the West. Our congress is
already nearly a battle-field. Our presses, in different sections,
are waging war upon one another, fierce and vindictive;
our whole people are divided up into parties&mdash;with
sectional interests and sectional jealousies.</p>

<p>Will the constitution, then, stand? We cannot say that
there is no danger; but there is ground of hope and courage.
Let the religion and patriotism of our fathers, be cultivated&mdash;let
our unquenchable love of liberty, and a profound reverence
for the constitution and the union, be instilled into
the minds of our children from their earliest days of thought
and reflection, and that noble instrument, and that glorious
union, will continue for generations to come.</p>

<p>I cannot better close these observations than by citing
some forcible and eloquent remarks of the late Judge Story,
addressed to the American youth.&mdash;"Let the American
youth," says he, "never forget that they possess a noble
inheritance, bought by the toils, and sufferings, and blood
of our ancestors; and capable, if wisely improved, and
safely guarded, of transmitting to their latest posterity all
the substantial blessings of life&mdash;the peaceful enjoyment of
liberty, of property, of religion, and of independence. The
structure has been erected by architects of consummate
skill and fidelity; its foundations are solid; its compartments
are beautiful, as well as useful; its arrangements are
full of wisdom and order; and its defences are impregnable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[Pg 541]</a></span>
from without. It has been reared for immortality, if the
work of man may justly aspire to such a title. It may,
nevertheless, perish in an hour, by the folly, or corruption,
or negligence of its only keepers, <span class="smcap">the people</span>. Republics
are created by the virtue, public spirit, and intelligence of
the citizens. They fall when the wise are banished from
the public councils because they dare to be honest, and the
profligate are rewarded because they flatter the people, in
order to betray them."</p>

<p>To the traveller whose lot has led him to traverse inhospitable
deserts&mdash;encounter fierce storms, and stem angry floods&mdash;it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[Pg 543]</a></span>
is delightful, at length, to enter a region where such
obstacles no longer impede his progress&mdash;where he breathes
with freedom&mdash;where he pauses to repose and refresh himself,
without the anticipation of similar immediate toil and
fatigue. It may not, indeed, be the end of his journey&mdash;and
he may not know with certainty the future issue of that
journey; but the aspect is less forbidding&mdash;the prospect is
even inviting&mdash;and he passes on, animated with the hope of
still better things to come.</p>

<p>Some such change we realize at the point at which we
have arrived, in following down the great events of American
history. Casting an eye upon the scenes of the past,
little besides toil, agitation, and conflict, are to be seen.</p>

<p>The Pilgrim Fathers land on these western shores.
Immediately, a wide-spread wilderness is before them, and
the task of clearing it is begun; savage foes&mdash;subtle,
secret, and sanguinary&mdash;prowl about their habitations, and
for years agitate and distress them. The mother-country
becomes involved in continental wars&mdash;America is the
theatre of the contest, and American soldiers must fight
her battles. But, like the palm-tree, the colonists rise under
the burdens imposed on them. As they prosper and expand,
England becomes jealous, and bears herself lordly towards
them, in measures of oppression&mdash;in prohibitions and exactions.
War ensues&mdash;a long and exhausting war; their
fields lie neglected; their cities are captured; their families
are impoverished, and their sons are slain; but they conquer,
and are free. But, as a nation, they have no sufficient bond
of union&mdash;no efficient government to guide their future destiny
in safety. National and state debts rest as an incubus
upon their efforts, and no adequate power exists by which
to provide for their liquidation. A convention meets:
different plans are proposed&mdash;different constitutions are
discussed. Obstacles to the adoption of any arise, which
appear insurmountable, and the convention is on the eve of
dissolving&mdash;leaving the problem still unsolved, whether
human wisdom is adequate to devise a constitution which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[Pg 544]</a></span>
shall harmonize the conflicting interests of thirteen free and
independent states.</p>

<p>Once more Providence rallies to our aid&mdash;moving upon
untractable spirits, as in days of yore the spirit had moved
upon the troubled waters, and now, as then, there "is a calm."
Deliberations are resumed&mdash;asperities wear away&mdash;harmony
succeeds&mdash;the final vote is taken&mdash;a constitution is
adopted, and sent abroad among the people of the states.</p>

<p>But again the waters become tumultuous&mdash;angry conflict
is waged in almost every state-house in the land&mdash;hundreds
and thousands lift up their voices against this constitution,
and refuse to sanction it&mdash;ill-boding doubts swell up like
clouds gathering from the sea, and for a time exclude all
hope of a constitutional ratification.</p>

<p>But another becalming influence from on high moves
upon the mental mass; jarring strifes are suspended&mdash;angry
discord ceases&mdash;harmonious action succeeds&mdash;the constitution
is ratified, <i>and George Washington is elected president
of the United States</i>!</p>

<p>On the ratification of the constitution, the attention of the
people was at once directed to General Washington, as the
first president of the United States. Communications,
expressive of this general desire, were made to him. "We
cannot," said Mr. Johnson, of Maryland, "do without you,
and I and thousands more can explain to any body but
yourself, why we cannot do without you." "I have ever
thought," said Governeur Morris, "and have said, that you
must be president; no other man can fill that office." In a
letter on the subject, addressed to Washington by Colonel
Hamilton, the latter said, "You will permit me to say, that
it is indispensable you should lend yourself to its [the government's]
first operations."</p>

<p>Washington had serious objections to becoming a candidate.
He sincerely wished for retirement. "It is my great
and sole desire"&mdash;so he expressed himself to a friend, who
had written him&mdash;"to live and die in peace and retirement
on my own farm."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[Pg 545]</a></span></p>

<p>But the voice of the nation demanded a further sacrifice
from the noble and disinterested patriot. He alone was
believed to fill so prëeminent a station in public opinion,
that he might be placed at the head of the nation without
exciting envy. He alone possessed the requisite confidence
of the nation.</p>

<p>By the constitution, the new government was to commence
its operations on the 4th of March, 1789; but a
quorum of representatives did not appear till the 1st, nor
of senators till Monday, the 6th day of April.</p>

<p>On this latter day, the president of the senate, elected for
the purpose of counting the votes, declared to the senate,
that the senate and house of representatives had met, and
that he, in their presence, had opened and counted the
votes for the electors for president and vice-president of
the United States; whereby it appeared that <span class="smcap">George
Washington</span> was unanimously elected president. The
following table exhibits the votes of the several electoral
colleges:</p>

<p>Whereupon, a certificate and letter&mdash;the one prepared
by a committee of the senate, the other by its president&mdash;were
communicated to General Washington, setting forth
his election, and expressing the cordial wish, that so auspicious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[Pg 546]</a></span>
a mark of public confidence would meet his
approbation.</p>

<p>This certificate and letter were received by Washington,
at Mount Vernon, on the 4th of April. He doubtless appreciated
the honor done him, and was grateful to the people
for the confidence reposed in him; but he would have
declined the office, had the convictions of duty allowed.
That, however, was not permitted; and, yielding to the
wishes of the nation, he took leave of Mount Vernon on the
second day after receiving notice of his appointment, and
proceeded to New York, at that time the seat of government&mdash;"bidding
adieu," as he wrote in his diary, "to private
life and domestic felicity; and, with a mind oppressed with
more anxious and painful sensations than I have words to
express."</p>

<p>The state of the public business required his immediate
presence at the seat of government; but the desire to see
the first president of the United States&mdash;the zeal and enthusiasm
which were kindled up along the whole route he was
to take, rendered it impossible to proceed with haste.
Crowds flocked around him, wherever he stopped; and
corps of militia, and companies of the most respectable
citizens, escorted him through their respective streets.</p>

<p>On reaching New York, April 23d, he was received with
due ceremony by the governor of that state, and conducted
with military honors through an immense concourse of people,
to the apartments provided for him. Here he received
the salutations of foreign ministers, public bodies, political
characters, and private citizens of distinction, who pressed
around him to offer their congratulations, and to express
their joy at seeing the man, who had the confidence of all,
at the head of the American republic.</p>

<p>On Thursday, the 30th of April, the new president was
inaugurated. The oath of office was administered by the
chancellor of the state of New York, in the presence of
the senate and house of representatives, and an immense
concourse of people, who attested their joy by loud and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[Pg 547]</a><br /><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[Pg 548]</a></span>
repeated acclamations. From the open gallery adjoining
the senate-chamber, which had been the scene of this new
but imposing scene, the assembly returned to the senate-chamber,
where the president delivered an inaugural
address; in which, after alluding to the "anxieties" occasioned
by his election to the chief magistracy, and the fond
hope he had indulged of spending the remainder of his
days in the "retreat" to which he had retired, after years
of military toil and strife, he proceeded in terms alike honorable
to himself as a Christian and a patriot: "It would be
peculiarly improper to omit, in this first official act, my
fervent supplications to that Almighty Being who rules
over the universe&mdash;who presides in the councils of nations&mdash;and
whose providential aids can supply every human
defect, that his benediction may consecrate to the liberties
and happiness of the people of the United States, a government
instituted by themselves for these essential purposes:
and may enable every instrument employed in its administration
to execute, with success, the functions allotted to his
charge. In tendering this homage to the Great Author of
every public and private good, I assure myself that it
expresses your sentiments not less than my own; nor those
of my fellow-citizens at large, less than either. No people
can be bound to acknowledge and adore the invisible hand
which conducts the affairs of men, more than the people
of the United States. Every step by which they have
advanced to the character of an independent nation, seems
to have been distinguished by some token of providential
agency; and in the important revolution just accomplished
in the system of their united government, the tranquil
deliberations, and voluntary consent of so many distinct
communities, from which the event has resulted, cannot be
compared with the means by which most governments
have been established, without some return of pious gratitude,
along with an humble anticipation of the future blessings
which the past seem to presage. These reflections,
arising out of the present crisis, have forced themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[Pg 549]</a></span>
too strongly on my mind to be suppressed. You will join
with me, I trust, in thinking that there are none, under the
influence of which the proceedings of a new and free government
can more auspiciously commence."</p>

<p>Such were the sentiments of the patriot&mdash;the sage&mdash;the
Christian statesman, as he was about to enter upon the
duties of an office, upon the faithful or unfaithful discharge
of which, was to depend the perpetuity or speedy annihilation
of a constitution of government, which had cost thousands
of lives and millions of revenue&mdash;besides involving
the happiness of unborn millions. Washington had surveyed
the wide field of responsibility. He came to the
high and sacred office reluctantly indeed, but in reliance
upon that Divine arm which had been his stay in the dark
and stormy days of the Revolution. Having put his hand
to the plough, he was not the man to look back. Having
passed the Rubicon, his march was forward. Immediately
following the delivery of the above address, the president,
with the members of both houses, attended divine service
at St. Paul's chapel. Thus did Washington, and thus did
the national assembly, commence the government with a
<i>devout recognition of its dependence upon Divine Providence
for success</i>. Happy for the country, if the same
spirit of piety, and the same acknowledgments to the
Divine Author of all good, had descended to after years.</p>

<p><i>System of Revenue.</i>&mdash;The first duty, under the federal
constitution, to which congress was called, was to provide
a revenue for the support of the government. For this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[Pg 550]</a></span>
purpose duties were laid on imported merchandize and on
the tonnage of vessels; thus drawing into the national
treasury funds, which had before been collected and appropriated
by the individual states. To counteract the commercial
regulations of foreign nations, and encourage
American shipping, higher tonnage duties were imposed on
foreign than on American vessels, and ten per cent. less duty
on goods imported in vessels belonging to the citizens of the
United States than the same goods brought in those owned
by foreigners.</p>

<p><i>Regulation of Departments.</i>&mdash;Three executive departments
were created, designed to aid the president in the
management of the government. These were styled
departments of <i>war</i>, of <i>foreign affairs</i>, and of the <i>treasury</i>.
The heads of these departments were to be called <i>secretaries</i>,
and to receive a salary of three thousand five hundred dollars.
They were intended to constitute a council, to be consulted
by the president at his pleasure; and their opinions, on all
important questions, he was authorized to require in writing.</p>

<p>In framing the acts establishing these departments, a
question arose of serious magnitude, viz: "In what manner,
and by whom, these important officers could be <i>removed
from office</i>?" The constitution was explicit in regard to
their appointment, giving the power of nominating to the
president, and that of confirming or rejecting the nomination
to the senate; but it was silent as to removal. Some
few maintained that they could be removed only by
impeachment; but the principal question was, "whether
they were removable by the president alone, or by the
president with the concurrence of the senate?"</p>

<p>The debate on this question was long and animated. It
was claimed, by one portion of the members, that as the
senate had a voice in the appointment of these officers, they
should have a voice in case of their removal; that such
power entrusted to one man might be abused&mdash;if not by
Washington, by some of his successors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[Pg 551]</a></span></p>

<p>On the other hand, it was contended that, as it was made
the duty of the president to see the laws faithfully executed,
he ought to have the power of dismissing those agents who
were unfaithful; otherwise, how, in many supposable cases,
could he secure a faithful execution of the laws? It was
further urged, that the mal-conduct of an officer might
require his immediate dismission, before the senate&mdash;a body
scattered over the states&mdash;could be convened. True, the
power might be abused, and, in the hands of an ambitious
man, perhaps would be; but such abuse would, in due time,
be rebuked by the people, and the abuser of this delegated
power, be displaced with dishonor. "The danger," said
Mr. Madison, "consists in this: the president can displace
from office a man whose merits require that he should be
continued in it. What will be the motives which the president
can feel for such abuse of his power, and the restraints
to operate to prevent it? In the first place, he will be
impeachable by this house, before the senate, for such an
act of mal-administration; for I contend, that the wanton
removal of meritorious officers, would subject him to
impeachment, and removal from his own high trust."</p>

<p>The difference of opinion on this great question, gave
rise to warm and protracted debates. A majority of both
houses, however, at length decided, that <i>the power of
removal is in the president alone</i>. Several who had been
members of the convention which framed the constitution,
were, at this time, members of the house of representatives.
They were equally divided on the question&mdash;Mr. Madison
and Mr. Baldwin, supporting the construction finally adopted
by congress: Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Gerry, opposing it.</p>

<p><i>Amendments of the Constitution.</i>&mdash;The states of New
York and Virginia, although they ratified the constitution,
were solicitous to have certain amendments adopted, which,
in separate memorials, they presented to congress, and
urged that body to call another convention for their adoption.
Congress, however, had no authority to call a convention.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[Pg 552]</a></span>
Mr. Madison submitted to the house several
amendments, which, together with those presented by
several of the states, were referred to a committee, consisting
of one member from each state. This committee,
at length, reported several amendments; twelve of which,
after various alterations, were agreed to by both branches
of congress, and sent to the states. These amendments
related to religion&mdash;keeping or bearing arms in time of war&mdash;quartering
soldiers, citizens, &amp;c., &amp;c. Ten of these
articles were at length ratified by the state legislatures, and
became a part of the constitution.</p>

<p><i>Establishment of a Judiciary.</i>&mdash;"A national judiciary
was also established during this session, consisting of a
supreme court, circuit, and district courts. The bill for
carrying this part of the constitution into effect, originated
in the senate, and was drawn up by a committee, of which
Mr. Ellsworth was chairman. The district courts were to
consist of one judge in each state. The states were divided
into circuits, in each of which, one of the judges of the
supreme court, and the district judge of the state in which
the court was held, constituted the circuit courts. In
certain cases, this court had original jurisdiction, and also
took cognizance of appeals from the district courts. The
supreme court was composed of a chief justice and five
associate judges, and was to hold two sessions annually, at
the seat of government. This court had exclusive jurisdiction
in certain cases, and appellative jurisdiction from the
circuit courts, and also from the state courts, in cases where
the validity of treaties, and the laws of the United States
were drawn in question. This organization of the federal
judiciary, has remained nearly the same to the present time,
except for a short period, when a different system, relative
to the circuit courts, was established, but which was soon
abolished, and the old system restored."<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> John Jay was

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[Pg 554]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Assumption of Debts.</i>&mdash;The second session of the first congress
began on the 6th of January, 1790. At the close of
the preceding session, the secretary of the treasury had
been directed to prepare a plan for providing for the
adequate support of the public credit, and to report the
same at the next meeting of congress. On the 15th, in
obedience to the foregoing requisition, Mr. Hamilton submitted
his report. Having dwelt with great ability upon
the importance of a nation maintaining the public credit, he
proposed, as the means of supporting that of the United
States, a system of assuming or funding not only the public
debt, but also the state debts, and of making provision for the
payment of the interest by taxes imposed on certain articles
of luxury, and on spirits distilled within the United States.</p>

<p>The debates on this report were exciting beyond precedent.
While not much difference existed as to funding the
foreign debt, a strong opposition arose, on the part of the
democratic party, against discharging, in full, the domestic
debt, and the assumption of the state debts. The federalists
advocated the measure. The contest between the two
rival parties was strong, spirited, and even virulent. The
very foundations of the government were shaken; and
a writer has justly remarked, that to the differences which
were then created, and the excitement which sprung up
during the debates, may be ascribed "the origin of that
violent spirit which for years arrayed one part of the
American community against the other."</p>

<p>The division of sentiment among the members of congress
in relation to the full, or only a partial payment of the domestic
debt, arose from this. A considerable proportion of the
original holders of public securities had been compelled to
sell them at greatly reduced prices&mdash;even as low as two or
three shillings on the pound. These securities had been
purchased by speculators, with the expectation of ultimately
receiving the full amount. "The federalists were with
Hamilton, in favor of making no difference between the
present and original holders of the continental bills, maintaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[Pg 555]</a></span>
that the government ought not to interfere with
transfers. The republican party advocated the discrimination;
contending that it was unjust to the veterans of the
Revolution, who had been obliged to receive this paper in
lieu of gold and silver, and were afterwards compelled to
part with it at a small part of its nominal value, now to be
condemned to poverty, while the speculator was receiving
the reward of their blood and service."</p>

<p>The assumption of the state debts was also violently
opposed. The advocates of assumption claimed that the
debts incurred by the state, were not for their own benefit,
but for the promotion of the common cause, and that therefore
it was right that the whole nation should be responsible.
The debts of the states most active in the war, were the
greatest: those of Massachusetts and Carolina amounted
to ten millions and a half, while those of all the other states
were not more than fifteen millions. Was it just to impose
such a burden on the people of these two states? They
had already been great sufferers in the privations they had
endured and in the blood they had lost.</p>

<p>On taking the vote in the house of representatives, these
two plans of Mr. Hamilton were lost by a majority of two;
and, for a season, there was little prospect that a just financial
system would be adopted, or that the respective parties
could on any basis coalesce. But, fortunately, at this
juncture, a question was exciting a deep interest, and with
reference to which there was a wide difference, and deep
feelings, between the northern and southern members, viz:</p>

<p><i>The Removal of the Seat of Government.</i>&mdash;The debates
on this subject were almost as exciting as on the fiscal
project of Hamilton. A compromise, however, was at
length effected in regard to the permanent location of the
seat of government&mdash;the more important, as it led to a further
compromise in relation to the assumption of the state
debts. It was understood that should the seat of government
be fixed for ten years at Philadelphia, and afterwards at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[Pg 556]</a></span>
place to be selected on the Potomac, some of the members
of the house of representatives, from the Potomac, would
withdraw their opposition to Mr. Hamilton. This was
accordingly done, and his plans were adopted. The debt
funded amounted to a little more than seventy-five millions
of dollars, upon a part of which an interest of three per
cent. was paid, and upon the remainder six per cent.</p>

<p><i>National Bank.</i>&mdash;During the third session of congress,
Mr. Hamilton recommended the establishment of a national
bank. To such an institution, the republican party were
bitterly opposed, as aristocratical and unconstitutional.
Besides, they considered banking institutions useless; the
present bill, in several particulars, defective; but, more than
all, it was maintained that the constitution had not vested
the power in congress to charter a bank. The supporters
of the measure, of course, held opposite doctrines, and were
not less strenuous in maintaining them. The bill, however,
at length passed both branches of the national legislature;
but the different opinions entertained, and the asperity with
which they had been expressed, led the president to give to
the subject, as a constitutional question, more than ordinary
attention. To aid him in his decision, he required opinions
of his cabinet in writing. Mr. Jefferson and Mr. Randolph
opposed&mdash;Mr. Hamilton and General Knox sanctioned the
bill. After mature deliberation, the president became satisfied
of the constitutionality and utility of the bill; upon
which, he gave it his signature.</p>

<p>The capital stock of the bank was ten millions of dollars,
two millions to be subscribed for the benefit of the United
States, and the residue by individuals. One-fourth of the
sums subscribed by individuals was to be paid in gold and
silver, and three-fourths in the public debt. By the act of
incorporation, it was to be a bank of discount as well as
deposit; and its bills, which were payable in gold and silver
on demand, were made receivable in all payments to the
United States. The bank was located at Philadelphia, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[Pg 557]</a></span>
power in the directors to establish offices of discount and
deposit only wherever they should think fit within the
United States.</p>

<p>The duration of the charter was limited to the 4th of
May, 1811; and the faith of the United States was pledged
that, during that period, no other bank should be established
under their authority. One of the fundamental articles of
the incorporation was, that no loan should be made to the
United States for more than one hundred thousand dollars;
or to any particular state for more than fifty thousand; or
to any foreign prince or state, unless previously authorized
by a law of the United States. The books were opened
for subscription in July, 1791, and a much larger sum subscribed
than was allowed by the charter; and the bank
went into successful operation.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>The establishment of a national bank, in connexion with
the assumption of the state debts, contributed to the more
complete organization of two great parties, which had their
origin in difference of views regarding the constitution at
the time of its adoption.</p>

<p>Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Jefferson, both eminent for their
talents, and each with his adherents, were now openly
opposed on points which, as matters of policy, were deemed
of vital importance. The former was viewed, not only as
the author of the funding system, the bank, and other measures,
deemed either unconstitutional, or highly injurious to
the public interest, but was charged with hostility to republican
principles and to state rights. Mr. Jefferson, on the
other hand, was considered hostile to the constitution, and
was accused of being opposed to the administration of
which he was a member, and of taking measures to reduce
the powers of the general government within too narrow
limits. To Washington, this determined hostility of his two
principal secretaries was truly afflicting; and the more so,
when he found it so deep-rooted, as in no degree to yield to
his affectionate remonstrance.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[Pg 558]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Indian War.</i>&mdash;While the public councils were engaged
thus in matters of great national importance, the hostile
movements of the Indian tribes on the frontier began to
excite the anxious solicitude of all reflecting minds, especially
that of Washington himself. The Creeks at the South
had been at war with Georgia; but in 1790, their chief,
M'Gillivray, the son of a white man, had been induced to
go to New York, and conclude a treaty. This terminated
the war in that quarter; but pacific arrangements, which
had been attempted by the president with the tribes on the
north-western frontier, had proved ineffectual. The use of
other means for their pacification, therefore, became indispensably
necessary.</p>

<p>In 1790, congress, at the solicitation of Washington,
authorized the raising of about fifteen hundred men, of
whom three hundred were regulars, and the remainder
Pennsylvania and Kentucky militia. The command of
these was given to General Harmar, a veteran officer of
the Revolution, whose instructions required him to penetrate
to the Indian settlements on the Scioto and Wabash,
and destroy them.</p>

<p>In the execution of his commission, in October, General
Harmar detached Colonel Harden with six hundred militia
to reconnoitre the Indian settlements, and, if possible, to
bring them to an engagement; but the Indians, on the
approach of the Americans, fired their principal villages,
and fled to the woods. Thus foiled in his attempt to bring
the Indians to action, Colonel Harden was a second time
directed, with one hundred and eighty militia and thirty
regulars, to spy out the position and intentions of the foe.
Ten miles west of Chillicothe, sight was obtained of a considerable
body of Indians; at which, the Kentucky militia
suddenly became so alarmed as to flee. This evil example
was soon after followed by the Pennsylvanians&mdash;thus leaving
the thirty regulars to sustain an engagement with a
greatly superior force. They displayed the greatest heroism;
and maintained the action, until all but seven being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[Pg 559]</a></span>
overpowered, the latter effected their escape, and rëjoined
the army at Chillicothe.</p>

<p>The Indian settlements bordering on the Scioto were
now destroyed; which having been accomplished, Colonel
Harden was a third time detached with three hundred and
sixty men, of whom sixty were regulars, under command
of Major Wyllys. This force was attacked by a large body
of Indians at the junction of the St. Joseph with the St.
Mary. It was a most desperate contest. Here the militia
retrieved their character; nor did they attempt to retreat
till one hundred and nine men and officers lay dead on the
field. Of the sixty regulars, only ten survived, and among
the killed was their brave commander, Major Wyllys. Following
this reverse, the survivors of the detachments joined
the army, and retired to Fort Washington.</p>

<p>On the failure of General Harmar, Major General
Arthur St. Clair, governor of the North-west territory,
was appointed to succeed him. In 1791, at the head of
two thousand men, the latter entered upon an expedition
which had for its object the destruction of the Indian villages
on the Miami. On the 3d of November, the army
had proceeded within twelve or fifteen miles of the Indian
villages, at which point the General formed his forces in
two lines&mdash;the first, under command of General Butler,
composed the right wing, and lay with a creek immediately
in front of them. The left wing, under command of Colonel
Drake, formed the second, and lay with an interval of
some seventy yards between them and the first line. The
militia occupied a post across the creek, a quarter of a mile
in front.</p>

<p>On the following day, before sunrise, just after the troops
had been dismissed from the parade, an unexpected attack
was made on the militia, who fled in the utmost confusion,
and, in their flight, deranged the continental troops, who
were in the act of forming. The officers exerted themselves
to the utmost to restore order; but were not entirely
successful. The Indians fell upon them with savage impetuosity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[Pg 560]</a></span>
The action instantly became extremely warm.
The continental troops fought with spirit and determination;
the Indians, with fearful desperation, advancing to
the very mouth of the field-pieces.</p>

<p>At length, perceiving that the only hope of victory lay in
the use of the bayonet, an impetuous charge was made under
Lieutenant-colonel Drake, and the enemy driven several
hundred yards. But not being able to pursue the advantage
gained, the Indians turned, and renewed the attack.
Meanwhile, General Butler was mortally wounded, and the
right wing broken, the artillerists killed, the guns seized,
and the camp penetrated by the enemy. At this critical
moment, Major Drake was ordered to charge with the bayonet.
This order he executed with great intrepidity and
momentary success.</p>

<p>But the American troops, failing to keep their ranks, and
flocking together in crowds, were, in several cases, shot
down with but feeble resistance. At length, perceiving
that his officers had suffered greatly, and the remnant of his
army became more and more confused, General St. Clair
ordered a retreat. For some miles, the Indians followed;
but, fortunately for the surviving Americans, they at length
turned back, to plunder the camp of such articles as the
former had been obliged to abandon. The routed troops
now continued their flight to Fort Jefferson, a distance of
about thirty miles, throwing away their arms on the road.
At this place, leaving their wounded, the army continued
its retreat to Fort Washington.</p>

<p>The loss of the Americans was severe, amounting to
thirty-eight commissioned officers killed, and five hundred
and ninety-three non-commissioned officers and privates
slain and missing. The wounded amounted to between
two and three hundred officers and men, many of whom
subsequently died. The loss of the Indians bore no comparison,
it is thought, to that of the Americans. This
reverse was as unexpected as unfortunate; yet want of
neither ability, zeal, nor intrepidity was ascribed to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[Pg 561]</a></span>
commander of the expedition, by a committee of congress,
appointed to examine into the causes of its failure.</p>

<p>The subsequent history of this war is brief. In consequence
of an anticipated adjustment of existing difficulties
with the Indians, they having consented to a conference in
the spring of 1794, hostilities were for a time suspended.
But the proposed negotiations failing, General Wayne,
with nearly one thousand men, was sent into their country,
to reduce them to subjection. He engaged them in a sanguinary
battle on the 20th of August, 1794, on the banks
of the Miami, which resulted in their utter rout, and which
was followed by laying waste their whole country. By
means of this victory over the Miamies, a general Indian
war was doubtless prevented. On the 3d of August, a
treaty was concluded at Greenville, which established
peace between the United States and the Indian tribes, and
restored peace and tranquillity to the frontier settlements.</p>

<p><i>Rëelection of Washington.</i>&mdash;During the year 1792, as
the time approached for the election of a chief magistrate,
General Washington expressed his intention, to some of his
most intimate friends, to decline a rëelection. His age and
increasing infirmities rendered his retirement from the
cares of political life most desirable. In view of such
retirement, he had prepared a farewell address to the people.
But, through the persuasion of Jefferson, Hamilton,
Randolph, and others, he was induced to forego his private
wishes, and was unanimously rëelected to the presidency.
No such unanimity has since been manifested by the people
of the United States, in relation to the choice of a chief
magistrate; nor is such unanimity likely again to exist. And
most conclusively does it show, not merely the gratitude of
the nation to the man who had stood foremost in times of
peril, but its deep and universal sense of the purity of his
patriotism and the worth of his skill in moulding and
shaping the government still in its infancy. Such harmony
was alike honorable to the nation and to Washington.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[Pg 562]</a></span>
Mr. Adams was rëelected vice-president. The following

<p><i>Difficulties with France.</i>&mdash;The rëelection of Washington
may be justly considered as among the most signal favors
conferred on the American people. A revolution in France
was in progress, remarkable for the political changes it was
affecting and the sanguinary scenes which marked it.
Monarchy had been abolished, Louis XVI. had fallen by
the guillotine, a republic had been proclaimed, and the
national convention had made proclamation of war against
England, Holland, and Spain.</p>

<p>It was not unnatural that a people, who had themselves
just thrown off the yoke, and were beginning to taste the
sweets of liberty, as was the case with the Americans,
should deeply sympathize with a nation which was engaged
in a similar struggle for independence. From the commencement
of the French Revolution, in 1789, not only the
Americans, but the friends of liberty throughout the world,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[Pg 563]</a></span>
were full of hope that the political condition of France
might thereby be improved. And as that revolution progressed,
the interest deepened; and when, at length, the
Republic was proclaimed, "the affection of the American
nation to its ancient ally, became devotion." The enthusiasm
knew scarcely any bounds, and was frequently manifested
in the most extravagant manner.</p>

<p>Nor was it unnatural that the French people should look
to America for her sympathy and aid, in so important an
enterprise. They had, at a former period, helped her
through her struggle for independence, and now, that they
were embarked in a similar effort, could she withhold her
cöoperation and aid? They had reason to expect it, and
were not long in adopting measures to secure it.</p>

<p>The news of the declaration of war by France, against
the powers already named, reached the United States in
April, and with this intelligence arrived a new minister
from the French republic, Mr. Genet. Both these circumstances
contributed to "increase to an extraordinary degree
the excitement already existing in favor of France, and
disposed a large portion of the nation to an actual cöoperation
with their ally against the enemy."</p>

<p>Washington and his associates in power were friends to
liberty, and were well-wishers to the cause of true freedom
in France. But the Revolution was assuming a selfish and
sanguinary character, which betokened any thing but the
establishment of a free and enlightened constitutional government.
The most unbridled ambition for power was
beginning to show itself, and reason and religion were
apparently being deprived of their legitimate sway. In
addition to this, the United States were in no situation to
embark in angry conflict with Great Britain and other continental
powers. In such a conflict it was apparently the
wish of France to involve the country, and, to a considerable
portion of the American people&mdash;arising from their
prejudices against Great Britain&mdash;such an event would not
have been unacceptable. But Washington judged more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[Pg 564]</a></span>
wisely for the interests of the nation; and accordingly, on
the 22d of April, issued his proclamation of <i>neutrality</i>.</p>

<p>This neutral and pacific policy of the American government
had, however, no apparent influence upon the new
French minister. "Sanguine in his temperament, of uncontrolled
passions, excited to a degree of insanity by the newborn
ideas which raged in France, possessed of the wildest
dreams of national glory and aggrandizement&mdash;in a word,
the very incarnation of Jacobinism, he was the fittest brand
which the assembly could have selected to hurl into the
magazine of political strife. His reception at Charleston,
where he landed, was well fitted to encourage him. Public
authorities, and private citizens, vied with each other in
glorifying the representative of European democracy. On
all sides he beheld the disposition he desired, and he did
not delay in profiting by it. Vessels were at once fitted
out and armed, men were enlisted, and commissions issued
under her authority to cruise against the enemies of
France." Similar demonstrations of regard were shown
him in other places, as he proceeded towards Philadelphia,
and the same arrogant and haughty spirit was manifested
by him. Pursuing his design of involving the country in
war, in despite of public executive prohibition, he issued
commissions to capture, and to bring into American ports,
the vessels belonging to countries with whom the French
were at war.</p>

<p>It is not necessary further to detail the conduct, nor the
insolence of this infatuated man. Suffice it to add, that on
the meeting of congress, December, 1793, the proclamation
of neutrality was approved. Soon after, at the instance of
Washington, Mr. Genet was rëcalled by the French government,
which, at the same time, disapproved of his conduct.</p>

<p><i>Insurrection in Pennsylvania.</i>&mdash;The summer of 1794,
was signalized by an insurrection in the western counties
of Pennsylvania, commonly known as the "whiskey insurrection."
It had its origin in a dissatisfaction with a law<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[Pg 565]</a></span>
of congress, enacted in 1791, by which a duty was imposed
upon spirits distilled in the United States. The inhabitants
of that part of Pennsylvania were chiefly foreigners, and
consequently were less disposed to submit to the taxation
necessary to the support of government. Strong opposition
to the law was early manifested, and not a few outrages
were committed upon the revenue officers while in the
discharge of their duty&mdash;such as "whipping, tarring, and
branding."</p>

<p>In consideration of these objections, in 1791-92, congress
so modified the law, as to do away its most obnoxious
features. But the law was now turned to party purposes,
and the spirit of discontent was fostered and inflamed to an
excessive degree. The consequence was, that outrages
were renewed, and the wildest anarchy prevailed.</p>

<p>In September, 1792, the president issued his proclamation
against unlawful combinations, and legal measures were
adopted against such as refused to pay the tax imposed,
and also against the rioters. But these measures were of
no practical effect. The president's message was disregarded,
and the violence and extent of the combination
utterly prevented any enforcement of the law. The house
of the collector of Fayette and Westmoreland, was, in
November, 1793, entered at night by an armed party, and
the officer forced, at the peril of his life, to surrender his
commission and books.</p>

<p>After many fruitless efforts to appease the malcontents,
the government decided that its officers should be protected,
and the law, at all hazards, be sustained. Accordingly, in
July, a number of writs were issued, and the marshal dispatched
to serve them. In the performance of this duty in
Allegany county, he was fired upon. The following day,
the house of the inspector, General Neville, in the neighborhood
of Pittsburg, was assaulted&mdash;but the rioters were
repulsed. On the 17th, the attack was renewed, and, though
defended by a detachment from the garrison at Pittsburg, it
was taken and burned. The marshal and inspector were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[Pg 566]</a></span>
obliged to flee for their lives. The effect of this transaction
was electrical. The whole of western Pennsylvania was in
a blaze. All order was at an end. All law was prostrate.</p>

<p>It was now apparent that the interference of the general
government would alone suffice to rule the storm. Neither
the civil forces nor the local militia could be depended on.
General Washington, therefore, on the 7th of August, made
a requisition upon the governor of Pennsylvania and the
adjacent states for quotas of militia. Meanwhile, a proclamation
was issued to the insurgents to disperse, and a
general amnesty promised on condition of a peaceable
submission. These measures, however, had no effect. On
the 25th of September, the army was ordered to proceed.
On its approach, the principal leader fled. This removed
the great obstacle to a pacification, and a general submission
ensued on the arrival of the militia. Thus terminated a
rebellion which, for a time, threatened the most disastrous
consequences to the union. The enemies of the government
were not unwilling that it should spread wider and
wider; nor was foreign intrigue wanting to give it impulse.
Through the forbearing policy of Washington, in the first
instance, and his subsequent firm and decided measures,
the insurrection was quelled. A number of arrests were
made, and a few persons convicted. But all were at length
pardoned.</p>

<p><i>Jay's Treaty.</i>&mdash;For some time, the relations subsisting
between the United States and Great Britain had been far
from amicable. The original difficulties arose from the
non-execution of the treaty of peace&mdash;each nation charging
the other with the first infraction. The principal complaints
were, on the one hand, the non-delivery of the ports
held by the latter within the American lines, and the carrying
off the slaves at the close of the war; on the other,
the interposition, by the states, of legal impediments to the
recovery of debts contracted before the war. Added to
these sources of trouble, Great Britain was accused of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[Pg 567]</a></span>
exciting the hostility of the Indians on our northern frontier,
of impressing our seamen, and, still more recently, of
capturing our neutral vessels, retaliatory upon France,
which had set the example.</p>

<p>For these reasons, a war between the United States and
England was now a probable event. Nor were the friends
of France slow in fanning the flame of discord. The latter,
therefore, were greatly disappointed on learning that Great
Britain had rescinded her orders in relation to the capture
of neutral vessels. But it was a most fortunate circumstance
for the peace of the two countries. Immediately,
Washington, perceiving that an opportunity was presented
for a probable settlement of existing difficulties, on the 16th
of April, nominated John Jay, then chief justice, as envoy
extraordinary to the British court.</p>

<p>On the 7th of March following, 1795, a treaty of amity,
commerce, and navigation, concluded by Mr. Jay, arrived.
On the 8th, it was submitted to the senate.</p>

<p>The main feature of this treaty respected indemnity for
unlawful captures, which was provided for, but no redress
could be obtained for negroes carried away. The obstructions
to collecting debts were to cease, and the ports on the
frontiers were to be evacuated by the 1st of June, 1796.
Other stipulations were embraced, and the treaty was
limited to twelve years.</p>

<p>On the 24th of June, the senate advised the ratification
of the treaty by a vote of exactly two-thirds. It was well
known that the President was not entirely satisfied with it,
but he had determined to ratify it, if advised by the senate.
The cabinet was divided. The country was also divided.
Even the friends of England were disappointed in its provisions;
while her enemies were loud in their complaints and
threats. Boston and the other cities passed condemnatory
resolutions. In several cities, mobs threatened personal
violence to the supporters of the treaty. Mr. Jay was
burned in effigy; the British minister was insulted; and
Mr. Hamilton was stoned at a public meeting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[Pg 568]</a></span></p>

<p>Contrary to the predictions of many, the treaty, thus
ratified, settled the difficulties between the two countries,
which were on the eve of war. It even proved advantageous
to the United States.</p>

<p><i>Election of Mr. Adams.</i>&mdash;As the presidential term of
Washington was now drawing to a close, he signified his
intention to retire from the duties of public life. During
his administration, the people had become divided into two
great political parties; at the head of one, was Mr. Adams;
at the head of the other, Mr. Jefferson. The election was
characterized by a zeal corresponding to the interest taken
by the parties in their candidates, and their devotion to their
respective political creeds. The election resulted in the
choice of Mr. Adams, as may be seen in the following
official canvass of the votes:</p>

<p><i>Farewell Address.</i>&mdash;Washington's administration closed
on the 3rd of March, 1797. Shortly before, he held his
last formal levee. It was an occasion of deep, and even
solemn interest. The distinguished of all parties and opinions
were there&mdash;veterans of the revolution, "weather-stained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[Pg 569]</a></span>
and scarred"&mdash;statesmen, bent with the cares and
weight of years spent in the service of their country&mdash;executive
counsellors, who had stood by their chief, and
aided in giving shape, union, and strength to the youthful
republic&mdash;ministers from foreign governments, whose veneration
approached that of his countrymen&mdash;and finally, a
long line of private citizens, who admired and delighted to
do honor to the man. They had convened, not for the
last time to honor the president of the United States&mdash;the
permanency of the republic was no longer problematical&mdash;a
successor had been appointed, and hopes were reasonably
entertained that the bonds of union between the several
states would be strengthened in future years; but they
had come to bid "farewell" to Washington&mdash;to him, to
whose valor and wisdom the nation was prëeminently
indebted for its independence, and the prosperity of its
government&mdash;in short, to "a soldier, without stain upon
his arms&mdash;a ruler, without personal ambition&mdash;a citizen,
of self-sacrificing patriotism&mdash;a man, pure, unblemished,
and true in every relation he had filled&mdash;one, in short,
to whom all ages should point as the testimony, that virtue
and greatness had been and could be united."</p>

<p>To Washington, the occasion was no less solemn and
affecting. On retiring from the army, he had taken leave
of officers and soldiers, expecting to spend his future days
in the shade of his beloved Mount Vernon. Again he was
seeking that happy and peaceful retreat, and was glad to
be released from the cares and responsibilities of office;
but when he looked round upon faces long familiar, and
grasped the hands of those who had helped him in times of
anxiety and doubt, Washington's heart was affected. It is
said there were few smiles, but many tears seen during the
reception.</p>

<p>On leaving the seat of government, Washington presented
a token of regard to the principal officers of government.
His affection for them was sincere and abiding.
Towards the entire American people, he bore the kindness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[Pg 570]</a></span>
and good-will of a father. He wished their happiness.
He had spent years in their service, without emolument,
and even at the sacrifice of a portion of his patrimony; but
that was nothing, so long as he could see the government
stable, and the republic "one and indivisible." There
was, perhaps, no one subject which had occupied Washington's
thoughts, more than the union of the states. And
now that he was about to retire, he felt it to be befitting
him to express his views on some subjects connected, as he
thought, with the vital interests and the future glory of his
country. These he embodied in a "Farewell Address,"
which, for purity of language, beauty of conception, and
soundness of political sentiments, has never been equalled.
It can never be read but to be admired. There are but
two sentences which we shall cite from this address; but,
in respect to the future glory and prosperity of our country,
they are as the corner-stones to our national capitol:</p>

<p>"The <i>unity of government</i>, which now constitutes you
one people, is now dear to you. It is justly so; for it is the
mainspring in the edifice of your real independence; the
support of your tranquillity at home; your peace abroad;
of your safety; of your prosperity; of that very liberty
which you so highly prize."</p>

<p>"Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political
prosperity, <i>religion</i> and <i>morality</i> are indispensable supports.
In vain would that man claim the tribute of patriotism, who
should labor to subvert these great pillars of human happiness&mdash;these
firmest props of the duties of men and citizens."</p>

<p>On other subjects connected with the future welfare of
the country, he expressed opinions, of whose wisdom and
practical value, revolving years have given ample proof.
Against the spirit of innovation upon the principles of the
constitution, he gave solemn warning&mdash;against the spirit of
party, when bitter and exclusive, he uttered his solemn
remonstrance. Public credit should be maintained; public
economy practiced; and institutions for the education and
improvement of the public mind, liberally endowed.</p>

<p>On the 1st of March, Washington, now about to retire
from the presidency, addressed a communication to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[Pg 572]</a></span>
senate, desiring them to attend in their chamber, on Saturday,
the 4th, at ten o'clock, "to receive any communication
which the new president might lay before them, touching
their interests." In conformity with this summons, the
senate assembled at the time and place appointed. The
oath of office was administered by Mr. Bingham to Mr.
Jefferson, the vice-president elect. The customary oath
was next administered by the vice-president to the new
senate; which preliminary forms being finished, the senate,
preceded by their presiding officer, repaired to the chamber
of the house of representatives, to witness the ceremonies
of the inauguration of the new president.</p>

<p>Mr. Adams entered, accompanied by the heads of departments,
the marshal of the district and his officers, and took
his seat in the speaker's chair; the vice-president and secretary
of the senate were seated in advance on his right, and
the late speaker and clerk on the left; the justices of the
supreme court sat before the president, and the foreign
ministers and members of the house in their usual seats.
The venerable Washington himself also appeared. As he
entered, all eyes were turned towards him with admiration,
and every heart beat with joy at the complacency and
delight which he manifested at seeing another about to be
clothed with the authority he had laid aside.</p>

<p>In his inaugural address, Mr. Adams expressed his preference,
upon principle, to a free republican government&mdash;his
attachment to the constitution of the United States&mdash;an
impartial regard to the rights, interests, honor, and happiness
of all the states of the Union, without preference to a
Northern or Southern, an Eastern or Western position&mdash;a
love of equal laws and exact justice&mdash;an inflexible determination
to maintain peace and inviolable faith with all
nations&mdash;his regard for the institutions of religion, and the
propagation of knowledge and virtue among all classes,
&amp;c.; and, finally, he invoked the care and blessing of that
Almighty Being, who in all ages had been the Patron of order,
the Fountain of justice, and the Protector of virtuous liberty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[Pg 573]</a></span></p>

<p>Having concluded his address, the oath of office was
administered by Chief Justice Ellsworth. Washington was
the first to tender to the new president his heartfelt congratulations;
which having done, he bade adieu to the seat
of government, and hastened to the enjoyment of that peace
and quiet which he had long desired, and which he now
anticipated in his own beloved Mount Vernon.</p>

<p>The condition of the country, on the accession of Mr.
Adams, was highly prosperous. The constitution had been
tested through the vicissitudes of eight years, and had stood,
and continued to stand, as a monument of the political wisdom
of its framers. Fortunately, several of those sages had
borne conspicuous stations in the government from the time
of its organization. The president himself had been the
president of the convention which formed the constitution.
The true intent, therefore, of that instrument, both in its
general and special provisions, had become well understood;
its great principles had been applied, and found to answer
the most sanguine expectations of its patriotic projectors.</p>

<p>In relation to particular measures, Washington had shown
himself to be as skillful a statesman as he had proved himself
sagacious as a general. A credit had been established
for the country, whose soundness no capitalist doubted&mdash;an
immense floating debt had been funded in a manner
perfectly satisfactory to the creditors, and a revenue had
been secured sufficiently ample for the national demands.</p>

<p>Funds also had been provided for the gradual extinction
of the national debt; a considerable portion of it had, indeed,
been actually discharged, and that system devised which
did in fact, in the lapse of some years, extinguish the whole.
The agricultural and commercial thrift of the nation had
been beyond all former example, and beyond all anticipation.
The numerous and powerful tribes of Indians at the
West, had been taught by arms and by good faith to respect
the United States, and to desire their friendship.</p>

<p>The principal events which distinguished the administration
of Mr. Adams, were,</p>

<p><i>Difficulties with France.</i>&mdash;The misunderstanding between
France and the United States, which had commenced during
the administration of Washington, not only extended into
that of Mr. Adams, but, soon after his accession, assumed
a still more formidable and even warlike aspect.</p>

<p>The seditious conduct of Mr. Genet, the French minister,
and his rëcall, were noticed when reciting the prominent
events of Washington's administration. He was succeeded
by Mr. Fauchet, who arrived in the United States in February,
1794. The conduct of this functionary, if less
exceptionable than his predecessor, was by no means
calculated to restore the harmony of the two governments.
Fauchet, believing that a large party in the United States
sympathized with him and his government, insulted the administration
by accusing them of partiality to the English, enmity
to his nation, and indifference to the cause of liberty.</p>

<p>With a desire to restore the peace of the two governments,
General Washington, in 1794, rëcalled Mr. Morris,
our then minister to France, and appointed Mr. Monroe to
succeed him, a gentleman belonging to the republican party,
and, therefore, more acceptable to the French government,
and the more likely to succeed in a satisfactory adjustment
of existing difficulties. Mr. Monroe was received with
distinguished consideration, and as an evidence of his kind
reception, the flags of the two republics were entwined and
suspended in the legislative hall.</p>

<p>Mr. Adet soon after succeeded Mr. Fauchet. He brought
with him the colors of France, which were presented to the
government of the United States as a token of her sympathy
and affection for her sister republic. But when the former
discovered that the United States continued rigidly to maintain
their neutrality, her sympathy and affection suddenly
declined. Measures were adopted highly injurious to
American commerce. Her cruisers were let loose upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[Pg 575]</a></span>
our commerce, and hundreds of vessels pursuing a lawful
trade were captured and confiscated.</p>

<p>The favorable results anticipated from Mr. Monroe's
embassy to France signally failed. Whether this failure
proceeded from an impossibility of making terms with the
French government, or from a want of firmness and decision
on the part of Mr. Monroe, it may be difficult to decide.
But, dissatisfied with the tardy and unsatisfactory manner
in which the negotiation was conducted, the president
decided to rëcall Mr. Monroe. This was accordingly done,
and Mr. Pinckney was appointed to succeed him.</p>

<p>The object of Mr. Pinckney's mission was stated in his
letter of credence to be "to maintain that good understanding
which, from the commencement of the alliance, had
subsisted between the two nations; and to efface unfavorable
impressions, banish suspicions, and restore that cordiality
which was at once the evidence and pledge of a
friendly union." The French directory, however, refused
to acknowledge Mr. Pinckney in his official capacity; and,
at length, by a written mandate, ordered him to quit the
territory of the French republic.</p>

<p>Intelligence of these facts having been communicated
to Mr. Adams, he summoned congress by proclamation, to
assemble on the 15th of May, when, in a fine and dignified
speech, he stated the great and unprovoked outrages of the
French government. He expressed, however, his wish for
an accommodation, and his purpose of attempting it. Meanwhile,
he earnestly recommended the adoption of measures
of defence.</p>

<p>Accordingly, to prevent war, if practicable, Mr. Adams
appointed three envoys extraordinary to the French republic.
General Pinckney, then at Amsterdam, whither he had
retired on being ordered to leave France, Mr. Marshall and
Mr. Gerry. These, also, the directory refused to receive.
They were, however, addressed by persons verbally instructed
by Talleyrand, the minister of foreign relations,
and invited to make <i>proposals</i>. In explicit terms, these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[Pg 576]</a></span>
unofficial agents demanded a large sum of money before
any negotiations could be opened. To this insulting demand,
a decided negative was given. A compliance was, nevertheless,
repeatedly urged, until, at length, the envoys refused
to hold with them any further communications.</p>

<p>These matters becoming known in America, excited general
indignation. The spirit of party appeared to be extinct.
"Millions for defence, not a cent for tribute," the language of
Mr. Pinckney to the French government, resounded from
every quarter of the Union. The treaty of alliance with
France was declared by congress to be annulled; and authority
was given for capturing armed French vessels. Provision
was made for raising a regular army, and in case events
should render it expedient, for augmenting it. A direct
tax and additional internal duties were laid. To the command
of the armies of the United States, President Adams,
with the unanimous advice of the senate, appointed George
Washington, with the rank of lieutenant-general and commander-in-chief.
Washington reluctantly accepted the
office, declaring, however, that he cordially approved the
measures of the government.</p>

<p>The first act of hostility between the two nations, appears
to have been committed by the Insurgente, which captured
the American schooner Retaliation, and carried her into
Guadaloupe. Soon after, the Constellation, under the command
of Captain Truxton, went to sea, and in February,
1799, he encountered the Insurgente, which, after a close
action of about an hour and a half, he compelled to strike.
The rate of the Constellation was thirty-two guns; that of the
Insurgente, forty. The former had three men wounded, one
of whom shortly after died, and none killed; the latter had
forty-one wounded, and twenty-nine killed. This victory,
so brilliant and so decisive, with such a wonderful disparity
of loss, gave great <i>eclat</i> to the victor and to the navy.</p>

<p><i>Treaty with France.</i>&mdash;The bold and decided tone of the
Americans, added to their preparations for prosecuting a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">[Pg 577]</a></span>
war with vigor&mdash;and, perhaps, more than all, the success
of the American navy in various engagements, had the
desired effect. Overtures for renewing the negotiations
were received from the French directory, which were
immediately responded to by the president, by the appointment
of Oliver Ellsworth, chief justice of the United States,
Patrick Henry,<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> then late governor of Virginia, and William
Vans Murray, minister at the Hague, envoys extraordinary
for concluding a peace. On their arrival at Paris,
they found the directory overthrown, and the government
in the hands of Napoleon Buonaparte, as first consul.
By him they were promptly received, and a treaty was
concluded on the 30th of September, 1800; soon after
which, the provisional army in America was, by order of
congress, disbanded.</p>

<p><i>Death of Washington.</i>&mdash;The good and the great must
die, and, at length, America was called to mourn the
departure of the good and illustrious Washington. He
did not live, much as he desired that event, to witness the
restoration of peace.</p>

<p>On Friday, December 13th, while attending to some
improvements upon his estate, he was exposed to a light
rain, which that same night induced an inflammatory affection
of the windpipe. In the morning his family physician,
Dr. Craik, was called in; but the utmost exertions of medical
skill were applied in vain. Believing, from the commencement
of his complaint, that it would prove fatal,
Washington succeeded, though with difficulty, in expressing
a desire that he might be permitted to die without being
disquieted by unavailing attempts to rescue him from his
fate. When no longer able to swallow, undressing himself,
he retired to his bed, there to await his dissolution. To his
friend and physician he said, with difficulty, "Doctor, I am
dying, and have been dying for a long time; but I am not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[Pg 578]</a></span>
afraid to die." Respiration became more and more contracted
and imperfect, until half-past eleven on Saturday
night, when, retaining the full possession of his intellect, he
expired without a struggle. Thus, in the sixty-eighth year
of his age, died the "Father of his country." Intelligence
of this event, as it rapidly spread, produced spontaneous,
deep, and unaffected grief, suspending every other thought,
and absorbing every different feeling.</p>

<p>Congress unanimously resolved upon a funeral procession
in memory of Washington. On the appointed day the procession
moved from the legislative hall to the German Lutheran
church, where an oration was delivered by General Lee,
a representative from Virginia. The procession was grand
and solemn; the oration, eloquent and impressive: throughout
the Union, similar marks of affection were exhibited&mdash;the
whole nation appeared in mourning. Funeral orations,
commemorative of his virtues, were pronounced in almost
every city and town, and many were the tears shed by
young and old, as the excellencies of his character were
portrayed, and the services which he had rendered in
achieving the independence, and contributing to the happiness
of his country, were reviewed.</p>

<p>Washington deserved all the public honors which were
paid him, and yet he needed none of them to add to the
celebrity of his name, or the glory of his achievements.
Wherever the story of his greatness, and of his patriotic
services, has travelled, it has elicited the admiration and
homage of mankind. Indeed, among civilized people of all
countries, his name has become a household word, and is
identified with all that is wise, and pious, and patriotic. By
the aged warriors of our Western tribes&mdash;now indeed few
and far between&mdash;he is still remembered as "our Father:"
his name is familiar to the wandering Bedouin, and his fame
has penetrated to the mountain fastnesses of the roving
Tartar. And in all future time&mdash;at least while the American
republic has a name and a place on the earth&mdash;or while
the record of her Revolution, and the establishment of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[Pg 579]</a></span>
government shall last&mdash;the name of Washington will be
remembered with gratitude and joy. "His country is his
monument, and her history his epitaph."</p>

<p>The character of Washington has been so often portrayed,
that we shall not deem it necessary to enter upon a formal
review of it in these pages. It may be, perhaps, a more
grateful service which we render, to garner up some "tributes"
to his exalted worth, which have been paid him by
some of the most distinguished men in other countries.</p>

<p>Said Mr. Fox, in the British parliament, in a speech
delivered during Washington's second presidential term:
"Illustrious man! deriving less honor from the splendor of
his situation than the dignity of his mind: before whom all
borrowed greatness sinks into insignificance, and all the
potentates of Europe (excepting the members of our own
royal family) become little and contemptible!"&mdash;Said Napoleon&mdash;a
man not wont to lavish his praises&mdash;and yet a man
who understood and could appreciate noble qualities existing
in others&mdash;said Napoleon&mdash;"Washington is dead! The
great man fought against tyranny; he established the liberty
of his country. His memory will always be dear to the
French people, as it will to all freemen of the two worlds."</p>

<p>Byron has added his testimony to the excellency and
glory of Washington&mdash;a tribute of praise which, it is said, he
has no where in any of his writings paid to a British hero, not
even to Wellington himself. "After taxing his misanthropy
for the bitterest forms of speech, to be applied to the fallen
Napoleon, and to mock at the fearful reverses of the French
emperor's fortune, he, by some strange impulses, winds up
his scorching lyric with these few lines:"</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Where shall the weary eye repose<br /></span>
<span class="i1">When gazing on the great&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Where neither guilty glory glows,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Nor despicable state?<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Yes&mdash;one&mdash;the first&mdash;the last&mdash;the best&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The Cincinnatus of the West,<br /></span>

</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[Pg 580]</a></span></p>
<p>Beautiful is the tribute&mdash;and as just as beautiful&mdash;which
the Professor of Modern History, in the English University
of Cambridge (William Smith, Esq.), pays to the sage
of Mount Vernon. "Instances may be found," says he,
"when perhaps it may be thought that he was decisive to a
degree that partook of severity and harshness, or even
more; but how innumerable were the decisions which he
had to make! How difficult and how important through the
eventful series of twenty years of command in the cabinet or
the field! Let it be considered what it is to have the management
of a revolution and afterwards the maintenance of
order. Where is the man that, in the history of our race,
has ever succeeded in attempting successively the one and
the other? The plaudits of his country were continually
sounding in his ears, and neither the judgment or the virtues
of the man were ever disturbed. Armies were led to
the field with all the enterprise of a hero, and then dismissed
with all the equanimity of a philosopher. Power
was accepted&mdash;was exercised&mdash;was resigned precisely at
the moment and in the way that patriotism directed. Whatever
was the difficulty, the trial, the temptation, or the danger,
there stood the soldier and the citizen, eternally the same,
without fear and without reproach, and there was the man
who was not only at all times virtuous, but at all times wise.</p>

<p>"As a ruler of mankind, he may be proposed as a model.
Deeply impressed with the original rights of human nature,
he never forgot that the end and aim of all just government
was the happiness of the people, and he never exercised
authority till he had first taken care to put himself clearly
in the right. His candor, his patience, his love of justice,
were unexampled; and this, though <i>naturally</i> he was not
patient&mdash;much otherwise, highly irritable."</p>

<p>"Of all great men"&mdash;such is the declaration of Mr.
Guizot, one of the ministers of the late king of the French&mdash;"of
all great men, Washington was the most virtuous and
the most fortunate. In this world, God has no higher favors
to bestow."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[Pg 581]</a></span></p>

<p>A writer in the Edinburgh Review, expresses himself in
terms equally honorable to the American Fabius: "If profound
sagacity, unshaken steadiness of purpose, the entire
subjugation of all the passions, which carry havoc through
ordinary minds, and oftentimes lay waste the fairest prospects
of greatness&mdash;nay the discipline of those feelings that
are wont to lull or seduce genius, and to mar and to cloud
over the aspect of virtue herself&mdash;joined with, or rather
leading to, the most absolute self-denial, the most habitual
and exclusive devotion to principle&mdash;if these things can
constitute a great character, without either quickness of
apprehension or resources of information, or circumventive
powers, or any brilliant quality that might dazzle the vulgar&mdash;then
<i>Washington was the greatest man that ever lived
in this world, uninspired by divine wisdom, and unsustained
by supernatural virtue</i>."</p>

<p>To the foregoing, we may add an extract from the eloquent
peroration of Lord Brougham, in his masterly essay
on "Public Characters." "This is the consummate glory
of the great American; a triumphant warrior, where the
most sanguine had a right to despair; a successful ruler,
in all the difficulties of a course wholly untried; but a warrior,
whose sword only left its sheath when the first law of
our nature commanded it to be drawn; and a ruler who,
having tasted of supreme power, greatly and unostentatiously
desired that the cup might pass from him, nor
would he suffer more to wet his lips than the most solemn
and sacred duty to his country and his God required." "It
will be the duty of the historian and the sage in all ages to
omit no occasion of commemorating this illustrious man;
and until time shall be no more, will a test of the progress
which our race has made in wisdom and in virtue be
derived from the veneration paid to the immortal name of
Washington!"</p>

<p>Such were some of the attributes, the virtues, the services
of Washington, and such the tribute paid to his greatness,
his worth, and his unequalled glory, as a man, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[Pg 582]</a></span>
military chieftain, and a ruler. More might be added, but
it is unnecessary, unless it be, that Washington was a
Christian. Every where&mdash;in seasons of trial, peril, and
almost of hopeless despondency&mdash;he placed his reliance
upon that Great Being who holds in his hand the fate of
men and of nations. His hopes for his country were
founded more on the righteousness of her cause, and on the
blessing of Heaven, than on the number or strength of his
army. Of his religion, he made no parade&mdash;of his virtues,
no boast&mdash;but he was ever more true to the dictates of
piety, and observant of the forms and institutions of the
Gospel. And it was this reliance upon that Gospel, which
enabled him to say, in the closing moments of life, "I am not
afraid to die."</p>

<p>In conclusion, we may add, in the highly laudatory and
just language of another, "Washington stands almost alone
in the world. He occupies a region where there are,
unhappily for mankind, but few inhabitants. The Grecian
biographer could easily find parallels for Alexander and
Cæsar; but, were he living now, he would meet with great
difficulty in selecting one for Washington. There seems to
be an elevation of moral excellence, which, though possible
to attain to, few ever approach. As, in ascending the lofty
peaks of the Andes, we at length arrive at a line where
vegetation ceases, and the principle of life seems extinct;
so, in the gradations of human character, there is an elevation
which is never attained by mortal man. A few have
approached it, but none nearer than Washington.</p>

<p>"He is eminently conspicuous as one of the great benefactors
of the human race; for he not only gave liberty to
millions, but his name now stands, and will for ever stand, a
noble example to high and low. He is a great work of the
Almighty Artist, which none can study without receiving
purer ideas and more lofty conceptions of the grace and
beauty of the human character. He is one that all may
copy at different distances, and whom none can contemplate
without receiving lasting and salutary impressions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[Pg 583]</a></span>
the sterling value, the inexpressible beauty of piety, integrity,
courage, and patriotism, associated with a clear, vigorous,
and well-poised intellect.</p>

<p>"Pure and widely disseminated as is the fame of this
great and good man, it is yet in its infancy. It is every
day taking deeper root in the hearts of his countrymen and
the estimation of strangers, and spreading its branches
wider and wider to the air and the skies. He is already
become the saint of liberty, which has gathered new honors
by being associated with his name; and when men aspire
to free nations, they must take him for their model. It is,
then, not without ample reason that the suffrages of mankind
have combined to place Washington at the head of his
race. If we estimate him by the examples recorded in history,
he stands without a parallel in the virtues exhibited,
and the most unprecedented consequences resulting from
their exercise. The whole world was the theatre of his
actions, and all mankind are destined to partake, sooner or
later, in their results. He is the hero of a new species; he
had no model. Will he have any imitators? Time, which
bears the thousands and thousands of common cut-throats
to the ocean of oblivion, only adds new lustre to his fame,
new fame to his example, and new strength to the reverential
affection of all good men. What a glorious fame is his,
to be acquired without guilt, and enjoyed without envy! to
be cherished by millions living, hundreds of millions yet
unborn! Let the children of my country prove themselves
worthy of his virtues, his labors, his sacrifices, by reverencing
his name, and imitating his piety, integrity, industry,
fortitude, patience, forbearance, and patriotism. So shall
they become fitted to enjoy the blessings of freedom and
the bounties of Heaven."<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p><i>Removal of the Seat of Government.</i>&mdash;In the year 1800,
the seat of government, agreeably to a law passed by congress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[Pg 584]</a></span>
in 1790, was removed to Washington, in the District
of Columbia. This territory, ten miles square, had been
granted to the general government by the states of Virginia
and Maryland. Public buildings had been erected, and in
November of this year, congress, for the first time, held
their session in that place. After congratulating the people
of the United States on the assembling of congress, on the
prospect of a residence not to be changed, the president
said: "It would be unbecoming the representatives of this
nation to assemble, for the first time, in this solemn temple,
without looking up to the Supreme Ruler of the universe,
and imploring his blessing. May this territory be the
residence of virtue and happiness! In this city, may that
piety and virtue, that wisdom and magnanimity, that constancy
and self-government, which adorned the great character
whose name it bears, be for ever held in veneration.
Here, and throughout our country, may simple manners,
pure morals, and true religion, flourish for ever."</p>

<p><i>Election of Mr. Jefferson.</i>&mdash;At this period, a presidential
election recurred. From the time of the adoption of
the constitution, the republican party had been gradually
gathering strength, and, in anticipation of success, great
preparations were made by them to elect their candidates,
Mr. Jefferson and Mr. Burr. The candidates of the federal
party were Mr. Adams and General Pinckney.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for the federal party, the administration of
Mr. Adams had not been generally acceptable. "In the
early part of it, the acts by which the army and navy were
strengthened, and eighty thousand of the militia subjected
to his order, were represented, by the republicans, as proofs
that, however he might have been a friend to the constitution
of his country, he now either wished to subvert it, or was
led blindfold into the views of those who did. The republicans
scrupled the policy of a war with France, and denied
the necessity, even in case of such a war, of a large land
force. They believed that spirits were at work to produce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[Pg 585]</a></span>
this war, or to make the most of a disturbance, in order to
lull the people, while they raised an army, which they
intended as the instrument of subverting the republican,
and establishing a monarchical government."</p>

<p>These insinuations&mdash;or, more properly, charges&mdash;were
doubtless utterly groundless; but they served to bring Mr.
Adams' administration into disrepute, and to strengthen the
republican party, which were boastful of their superior
regard to the constitution, and friendship to the rights and
liberty of the people.</p>

<p>Other measures of the administration served to increase
the party odium against it, and, in the sequel, to overthrow
it. We allude particularly to two acts of congress&mdash;<span class="smcap">the
alien</span> and <span class="smcap">sedition laws</span>, of July, 1798.</p>

<p>The alien law empowered the president "to order all
such aliens as he should judge dangerous to the peace and
safety of the United States, or should have reasonable
grounds to suspect were concerned in any treasonable
or secret machinations against the government thereof, to
depart out of the territory of the United States, within such
time as should be expressed in such order." In case of
disobedience, such aliens, on conviction before the circuit
or district courts of the United States, were subjected to
imprisonment for not more than three years, and incapacitated
from becoming citizens. The subsequent law, respecting
alien <i>enemies</i>, enabled the president, on a declaration
of war, to cause the subjects of the belligerent nation "to
be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as alien
enemies." Under both these acts, they were permitted to
remove their property, and under the latter, if not chargeable
with crimes against the United States, to defend
themselves.</p>

<p>Of the two measures, the sedition act was by far the most
unpopular. "The other," says Mr. Tucker, "was condemned
by most Americans, like the stork in the fable, for
the society in which he was found, and for the sake of
soothing the great class of foreigners who were not yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[Pg 586]</a></span>
naturalized, the greater part of whom, particularly the Irish
and French, were attached to the republican party."<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>The sedition law, in some of its provisions, went still
further. It imposed fine and imprisonment for unlawfully
combining and conspiring with intent to oppose the measures
of government, when directed by the proper authority: for
impeding the operation of any law of the United States;
intimidating an officer from the performance of his duty,
or counselling or advising, with similar intent, insurrections,
riots, or unlawful combinations. It also imposed similar,
but lighter penalties, for the publication of false, scandalous,
and malicious writings against the government of the
United States, either house of congress, or the president,
with intent to bring them into contempt, &amp;c. The act was
limited to two years.</p>

<p>Such were the measures which at this most critical period
of our history were adopted, when the United States, if not
carrying on, were undergoing a war with France; and
when the country swarmed with secret spies and agents.
These laws have been condemned, and President Adams
and his government severely censured for having secured
their enactment. They were denounced at the time by the
republican party in no measured terms. They were claimed
to be unnecessary, cruel, and despotic.</p>

<p>But, while it is not our province to enter into a justification
of these laws, it may be proper to say, by way of
palliation, to use the language of another, "that the laws
themselves sprung from existing facts, and self-preservation
demanded that the power of providing for the public safety,
vested in every government by the very objects of government,
should now be used."<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>The sedition law was never enforced, except against a
few&mdash;Callender was one&mdash;an alien and a fugitive from
justice, who would have overthrown the government, in his
zeal to build up the republican party.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">[Pg 587]</a></span></p>

<p>The necessity for the laws regarding aliens, was more
apparent. The Frenchmen in the United States, at that
era, were estimated at thirty thousand. Many of them
were associated together in clubs, which had for their object
the furtherance of French interests. The number of British
subjects was still greater. Other foreigners were numerous,
and all were attached to France. They were restless,
feverish, factious. Whatever may be thought of the expediency
or justice of the law in question, no reasonable doubt
can be entertained of the necessity of some restrictive measures
in a time of such excitement as then prevailed. And
yet it must be admitted that no man was actuated by a
loftier patriotism than Mr. Adams; nor was any one ever
more ready to make sacrifices for his country's good. It is
sometimes urged that he was vain, self-willed, impulsive.
But these imperfections were relieved by noble virtues.
His political opponent&mdash;the man who supplanted him&mdash;declared
that he was the ablest advocate of independence.
In days when others desponded, he hoped.</p>

<p>The acts secured the object sought&mdash;they secured, if not
the peace, the safety of the country; for even while they
were in the process of enactment, not a few of the more
"notorious of the incendiaries" left the country. But they
largely contributed to the overthrow of the existing administration,
and the triumph of the democratic party.</p>

<p>As the constitution then existed, each elector gave his
vote for two persons, without designating which was to be
president&mdash;the one having the largest number being entitled
to the presidency, and the other to the vice-presidency.
Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr were the two candidates
of the republican party. Each of these having seventy-three
votes, it devolved upon the house of representatives
to decide between them. The federal party having been
defeated in respect to their candidates, sided with the
friends of Colonel Burr, in opposition to Mr. Jefferson.</p>

<p>As this was the first time that the election of a president
had thus devolved upon the house of representatives, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">[Pg 588]</a></span>
general interest was taken in the subject. But that interest
was greatly increased by the then existing state of political
parties. On the arrival of the time for the election, it was
decided that, after the balloting had commenced, no
adjournment should be had until a choice was made&mdash;that
during the balloting, the doors of the house should be
closed&mdash;that the delegation from each state should be
seated together&mdash;that the latter should first ballot among
themselves, and that duplicates of these ballots should be
made, and placed in separate boxes. When all the states
had thus voted, the ballot-boxes were to be carried by the
sergeant-at-arms to two separate tables. The ballots were
then to be counted by tellers, eight in number, at each
table. When counted, the reports were to be announced
from each table; if these reports agreed, they were to be
accepted, as the true votes of the states; but, if they differed,
a new balloting was to be made.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, the 11th of February, 1801, the balloting
commenced. On the first ballot, eight states voted for Mr.
Jefferson, six states for Mr. Burr, and the votes of two
states were divided. Unexpectedly, no choice was effected
during the first day, and an adjournment became necessary.
The balloting was continued on the following day, and,
indeed, until Tuesday, the 17th of February, when the
thirty-fifth ballot, as had all the previous ballots, resulted
the same as the first. The excitement of members, and of
citizens attracted from various parts of the country to see
the issue of a novel political contest, had now become
intense. Every possible influence was exerted by the
respective parties. Mr. Nicholson, of Maryland, being too
unwell to sit during the protracted ballotings, had a bed
prepared for him in one of the committee-rooms, to which
the ballot-box was carried by the tellers on the part of the
state. For several days, the members ate little, and slept
still less. At length, however, the long contest was terminated
by the thirty-sixth ballot, which resulted in the
election of Mr. Jefferson&mdash;ten states having voted for him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">[Pg 589]</a></span>
four for Mr. Burr, and two in blank. The following table
exhibits the final result:</p>

<p>Mr. Jefferson was inducted into office, with the usual
imposing ceremonies, on the 4th of March, 1801; on which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">[Pg 591]</a></span>
occasion, deviating from the example of his predecessors,
he transmitted to congress a <i>written message</i>, instead of
delivering a speech in person&mdash;a practice which has been
followed by his successors in the presidential chair, without
an exception.</p>

<p>This message was a remarkable document, inasmuch as
it set forth the "essential principles" of our government in
the narrowest compass, and with great clearness and precision
of language. These were, "Equal and exact justice
to all men, of whatever state or persuasion, religious or
political; peace, commerce, and honest friendship with all
nations, entangling alliances with none; the support of the
state governments, in all their rights, as the most competent
administrations for our domestic concerns, and the surest
bulwarks against anti-republican tendencies; the preservation
of the general government, in its whole constitutional
vigor, as the sheet-anchor of our peace at home and safety
abroad; a jealous care of the right of election by the people,
a mild and safe corrective of abuses, which are lopped by
the sword of revolution, where peaceable remedies are
unprovided; absolute acquiescence in the decisions of the
majority, the vital principle of republics, from which there
is no appeal but to force, the vital principle and immediate
parent of despotism; a well-disciplined militia, our best
reliance in peace, and for the first moments of war, till
regulars may relieve them; the supremacy of the civil over
the military authority; economy in the public expense, that
labor may be lightly burdened; the honest payment of our
debts, and sacred preservation of the public faith; encouragement
of agriculture, and of commerce as its handmaid;
the diffusion of information, and arraignment of all abuses
at the bar of the public reason; freedom of religion, freedom
of the press, and freedom of person, under the protection of
the <i>habeas corpus</i>; and trial by juries impartially selected.
These principles form the bright constellation which has
gone before us, and guided our steps through an age of
revolution and reformation."</p>

<p><i>Purchase of Louisiana.</i>&mdash;By the treaty of 1783, the
Mississippi was made the western boundary of the United
States, from its source to the thirty-first degree of latitude,
and following this line to the St. Mary's. By a treaty of
the same date, the Floridas were ceded to Spain, without
any specific boundaries. This omission led to a controversy
between the United States and Spain, which nearly
terminated in hostilities. By a treaty with Spain, however,
in 1795, boundary lines were amicably settled, and New
Orleans was granted to American citizens as a place of
deposit for their effects for three years and longer, unless
some other place of equal importance should be assigned.
No other place being assigned within that time, New
Orleans continued to be used as before.</p>

<p>In 1800, a secret treaty was signed at Paris, by the
plenipotentiaries of France and Spain, by which Louisiana
was guarantied to France, and, in 1801, the cession was
actually made. At the same time, the Spanish intendant
of Louisiana was instructed to make arrangements to
deliver the country to the French commissioners. Upon
receiving intelligence of this intended transfer, great sensibility
prevailed in congress, and a proposition was made to
occupy the place by force; but, after an animated discussion,
the project was relinquished, and negotiations with
France were commenced by Mr. Jefferson, for the purchase
of the whole country of Louisiana, which ended in an
agreement to that effect, signed at Paris, April 30th, 1803,
by which the United States were to pay to France fifteen
millions of dollars. Early in December, 1803, the commissioners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">[Pg 593]</a></span>
of Spain delivered possession to France; and, on
the 20th of the same month, the authorities of France duly
transferred the country to the United States.</p>

<p><i>War with Tripoli.</i>&mdash;In his message to Congress, in
1801, Mr. Jefferson spoke of the relations of the United
States with all nations as pacific, except with Tripoli, the
least considerable of the Barbary states. This power had
made demands, the most unjust, upon the American government,
and had threatened war, because that government
had failed to comply with those demands before a given day.
Thus threatened, the president had sent out Commodore
Dale with a squadron of two ships and a sloop-of-war, to
blockade the harbor of Tripoli, by which piratical cruisers
should be prevented from making depredations upon American
commerce.</p>

<p>In 1803, it became necessary to add to this Mediterranean
force. Accordingly, a squadron of seven sail was
ordered, of which Commodore Preble was put in command.
In October, the frigate Philadelphia, forty-four, Captain
Bainbridge, while in eager pursuit of a small vessel,
grounded in the harbor of Tripoli, and, in this situation,
was compelled to surrender. The officers became prisoners,
and the crew slaves. In this emergency, Stephen
Decatur, then a lieutenant under Commodore Preble, proposed
a plan for rëcapturing or destroying the Philadelphia.
The American squadron was at that time lying at Syracuse.
Agreeably to the plan proposed, Lieutenant Decatur, in
the ketch Intrepid, four guns and seventy-five men, proceeded,
under the escort of the Syren, Captain Stewart, to
the harbor of Tripoli. The Philadelphia lay within half
gun-shot of the bashaw's castle, and was guarded by
several cruisers and gun-boats. The Intrepid entered the
harbor alone, about eight o'clock in the evening, and succeeded
in getting near the Philadelphia, between ten and
eleven o'clock, without having awakened suspicion of her
hostile designs. This vessel had been captured from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[Pg 594]</a></span>
Tripolitans, and, assuming on this occasion her former
national appearance, was permitted to warp alongside.
The moment the vessel came in contact, Decatur and his
followers leaped on board, and soon overwhelmed the
crew. Twenty Tripolitans were killed. All the surrounding
batteries being opened upon the Philadelphia,
she was immediately set on fire; when, a favoring breeze
springing up, the Intrepid extricated herself from her prey,
and sailed triumphantly out of the harbor.</p>

<p>In July, 1804, Commodore Preble having concentrated
his forces before Tripoli, opened a tremendous fire of shot
and shells, which was as promptly returned by the Tripolitan
batteries and shipping. At the same time, two divisions
of gun-boats&mdash;the first under the command of Captain
Somers, the second under Lieutenant Stephen Decatur&mdash;advanced
against those of the enemy.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Decatur, bearing down upon one of superior
force, soon carried her by boarding; when, taking his prize
in tow, he grappled with another, and, in like manner,
transferred the fight to the enemy's deck. In the fierce
encounter which followed this second attack, Lieutenant
Decatur, having broken his sword, closed with the Turkish
commander, and, both falling in the struggle, gave him a
mortal wound with a pistol-shot, just as the Turk was
raising his dirk to plunge it into his breast. Lieutenant
Trippe, of Lieutenant Decatur's squadron, had boarded a
third large gun-boat, with only one midshipman and nine
men, when his boat fell off, and left him to wage the unequal
fight of eleven against thirty-six. Courage and resolution,
however, obliged the numerous foe to yield, with the loss
of fourteen killed and seven wounded. Lieutenant Trippe
received eleven sabre wounds, and had three of his party
wounded, but none killed.</p>

<p>On the 4th of September, Commodore Preble determined
to send a fire-ship into the enemy's harbor. For this service,
the Intrepid was fitted out, being filled with powder, shells,
and other combustible materials. Captain Somers conducted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">[Pg 595]</a></span>
the enterprise, having for his associates Lieutenants
Wadsworth and Israel, all volunteers. At eight o'clock in
the evening, she stood into the harbor, with a moderate
breeze. Several shots were fired at her from the batteries.
She had nearly gained her place of destination, when she
exploded, without having made any of the signals, previously
concerted, to show that the crew was safe. Night
hung over the dreadful catastrophe, and left the whole
squadron a prey to the most dreadful anxiety.</p>

<p>Doubt, however, was at length turned into certainty.
She had prematurely blown up, destroying one of the
enemy's gun-boats, and shattering several others. Commodore
Preble, in his account, says, that he was led to believe
that those boats were detached from the enemy's flotilla to
intercept the ketch, and, without suspecting her character,
had suddenly boarded her, when the gallant Somers and the
heroes of his party, observing the other three boats surrounding
them, and no prospect of escape, determined to
put a match to the train leading directly to the magazine;
and, he adds, that his "conjectures respecting this affair are
founded on a resolution which Captain Somers and Lieutenants
Wadsworth and Israel had formed, never to be
taken by the enemy, and never to suffer him to get possession
of the powder on board the Intrepid."</p>

<p>The reigning bashaw of Tripoli, at this time, was an
usurper, while the lawful one and an older brother, Hamet
Caramelli, was at Tunis in exile. At the commencement
of the war, William Eaton, then American consul at Tunis,
becoming acquainted with Hamet, concerted an expedition
to expel the usurper, and restore the rightful heir to the
throne. To such an enterprise, the sanction of the American
government being necessary, General Eaton repaired
to the United States, and laid his plan before our government;
but they, thinking the scheme altogether too romantic,
yet not wishing wholly to discourage it, made him
agent for the government; he sailed with the fleet for the
Mediterranean, and proceeding to Alexandria, prevailed on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">[Pg 596]</a></span>
the viceroy of Egypt to suffer him to have an interview
with the exiled bey. They met near Grand Cairo, and
entered into a convention for the purpose of attacking
Tripoli. Eaton was to be commander-in-chief of the land
forces. Their army consisted of a few American sailors,
a small company of artillery, a few straggling Greeks,
the servants of Hamet Bashaw, and some camel-drivers.
With this motley band, Eaton dashed across the desert in
the most noble style, fearless of all difficulties. Here he
was joined by a few Arabian cavalry, and, after suffering
every hardship, arising from hunger and a scorching sun,
the party reached Bomba, where they found the Argus and
Hornet, under the command of Captain Hull. The army, of
nearly four hundred, continued their march to Derne. On
the 25th of April, 1804, they encamped on an eminence
which commanded the place, and forthwith demanded a
surrender. The inhabitants of Derne treated the summons
with contempt. A furious assault was the consequence, and
the place was carried after a short but desperate action.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for Eaton's projects, at this time he
received intelligence that the American commissioners in
the fleet had made peace with the bashaw then in power.
It was stipulated, that Eaton should evacuate Derne, and
repair to the fleet; and that a mutual delivery of prisoners
should take place, among whom was Captain Bainbridge,
with the officers and crew of the Philadelphia; and, as the
bashaw had a balance of more than two hundred prisoners
in his favor, he was to receive sixty thousand dollars.
Hamet Bashaw accompanied Eaton to the United States,
with a few of his followers, while the remainder of the
army fled to the mountains. The commissioners acknowledged
that Eaton's success prepared the way for the treaty
of peace. Moreover, the president of the United States,
in a message to congress, spoke highly of his services; and
the citizens every where hailed him as worthy of a place
in the lists of chivalry; but, during his after-life, he ever
felt that injustice was done him by his countrymen, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">[Pg 597]</a></span>
Massachusetts made him a grant of ten thousand acres of
land as a reward for his services.</p>

<p><i>Murder of Hamilton.</i>&mdash;On the 12th of July, 1804, General
Alexander Hamilton died in the city of New York, in
consequence of a wound received the day previous, in a
duel fought by him with Aaron Burr.</p>

<p>In February, 1804, Colonel Burr was nominated as a
candidate for the office of governor of New York. Judge
Morgan Lewis was the opposing and successful candidate.
The contest was violent, and even "acrimonious." The
majority of the democratic party supported Judge Lewis;
a respectable minority favored the election of Colonel
Burr. Similar divisions existed among the federal party.
Hamilton and his immediate political friends were strong in
their opposition to Burr. In the contest, the press was
enlisted. Violent, and even libellous articles, were daily
published. In the progress of this warfare, a letter, written
by Dr. Charles D. Cooper to Colonel Burr, was published, in
which, among other matters, there occurred the following
clause: "I could detail to you <i>a still more despicable</i> opinion,
which General Hamilton <i>has expressed</i> of Mr. Burr."</p>

<p>At the request of Colonel Burr, Judge Van Ness called
upon General Hamilton, and demanded an explanation. A
few days following, the latter replied by letter, in which,
after expressing his embarrassment in attempting to meet a
charge so <i>indefinite</i>, he said: "I stand ready to avow or
disavow, promptly and explicitly, any precise or definite
opinion which I may be charged with having declared of
any gentleman. More than this cannot fitly be expected
from me; and, especially, it cannot be reasonably asked that
I shall enter into any explanation upon a basis so vague as
that you have adopted. I trust, on reflection, you will see
the matter in the same light with me."</p>

<p>Colonel Burr was not satisfied, and from this date, June
20th, the correspondence, thus begun, was continued to the
3d of July, when it was definitely arranged that a meeting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">[Pg 598]</a></span>
should take place between them on the morning of
the 11th, at Weehawk, on the Jersey shore, at seven
o'clock A. M.</p>

<p>That meeting took place. They fought at ten paces
distance. The fire of Colonel Burr took effect, and General
Hamilton fell. The ball passed through the liver and diaphragm,
and lodged in the vertebra. From the first, it was
apparent that the wound was mortal, and of this, Hamilton
was sensible. On the day following, he expired.</p>

<p>The seconds in this most unfortunate and criminal affair
were Mr. Pendleton, the friend of Mr. Hamilton, and
Judge Van Ness, the friend of Burr. By the former, it
was claimed that General Hamilton did not fire first, nor
at all at Colonel Burr. Several circumstances corroborated
this statement. In a paper, left by Hamilton, in anticipation
of his interview with Burr, he writes: "I have
resolved, if our interview is conducted in the usual manner,
and it pleases God to give me the opportunity, to
reserve and throw away my first fire, and I have thought
of even reserving my second fire, and thus give a double
opportunity to Colonel Burr to pause and reflect." Dr.
Hosack, his attendant physician on the ground, accompanied
him on his return across the Hudson to New York.
On their way, Hamilton, observing the pistol which he had
used lying in the boat, said: "Take care of that pistol; it is
undischarged, and still cocked; it may go off, and do harm.
Pendleton knows that I did not intend to fire at him."
"Yes," said Pendleton; "I have already made Dr. Hosack
acquainted with your determination."</p>

<p>It may be further added, and to the <i>dishonor</i> of Hamilton
it should be added&mdash;and perhaps as a solemn dissuasive
against a practice at war with reason, revelation, and all
the dear and important relations of life&mdash;that he accepted
the challenge, and repaired to that duelling-ground, contrary
to the convictions of conscience and duty. In the
paper already alluded to, he writes: "My religious and
moral principles are strongly opposed to the practice of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">[Pg 599]</a></span>
duelling, and it would ever give me pain to be obliged to
shed the blood of a fellow-creature in a private combat
forbidden by the laws."&mdash;In an interview with him, a few
hours before he expired, and as he was about to part with
him, the late Dr. Mason said to him, "I have one request to
make." He asked "what it was?" The doctor replied, that
"whatever might be the issue of his affliction, he would
give his testimony against the practice of duelling."&mdash;"I
will," said he; "I <i>have done it</i>. If <i>that</i>"&mdash;evidently anticipating
the event&mdash;"if <i>that</i> be the issue, you will find it in
writing. If it please God that I recover, I shall do it in a
manner which will effectually put me out of its reach in
future."</p>

<p>Nothing scarcely could exceed the indignation of the
public against the murderer of Hamilton. From that fatal
hour, he was shunned by all classes, and for years roamed
abroad, a fugitive from the land in which he was once honored.
Forgetting all party distinctions and animosities, the
people in various parts of the land united in demonstrations
of respect for the memory of Hamilton, and sincere sorrow
at his untimely fall. Next to Washington, no man was,
perhaps, more respected; nor since the departure of the
Father of his country to another world, was the loss of one
more deeply or widely deplored.</p>

<p>Hamilton had occupied a conspicuous place for years
in the army and under the government. In the former
capacity, he had stood by the side of Washington. He
loved military life, and, as a soldier and a patriot, deserved
well of his country. From his views on several subjects
connected with the organization of the government, and
especially the management of the finances of the country,
many dissented. Yet, it cannot be denied, that the policy
he advised, resulted in the prosperity of the country. He
was a strong partisan in his time, and tenacious of his
opinions. There were contemporary with him others of
a similar stamp, yet widely different from him in their
political views.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">[Pg 600]</a></span></p>

<p>But, aside from his political career, Hamilton was a distinguished
man&mdash;possessed of a lofty and comprehensive
mind. At the bar, with men of learning and experience, he
was, perhaps, without a rival. "His eloquence combined
the nervousness and copious elegance of the Greek and
Roman schools."</p>

<p>It was truthfully said of him, what was beautifully said
of another:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Incorrupta fides&mdash;nudaque veritas,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p><i>Rëelection of Mr. Jefferson.</i>&mdash;In 1805, Mr. Jefferson was
elected a second time to the office of president. The electoral
votes were one hundred and seventy-six, of which he
received one hundred and sixty-two. George Clinton was
chosen vice-president. The following is the official canvass

<p><i>Conspiracy and Trial of Burr.</i>&mdash;In the spring of 1807,
Colonel Aaron Burr was arrested on the Tombigbee river,
Mississippi territory, on a charge of treason against the
United States; and was conveyed to Richmond, Virginia,
for trial. Other arrests were made of persons supposed to
be concerned with him in his treasonable scheme&mdash;among
them were Generals Adair and Dayton, Blannerhasset,
Swartwout, Alexander, Smith, Bollman, Ogden, &amp;c. Burr
and Blannerhasset alone were brought to trial. The trial
of the former took place in May, 1807, before the circuit
court of the United States, Judge Marshall presiding. No
indictment was found by the grand jury until the 25th of
June, when two bills were presented against Burr&mdash;one for
treason, the other for a misdemeanor. On the 30th of June,
he was committed to the penitentiary for safe keeping
until the 3d day of August. From the 5th until the 17th of
August, the court was engaged in obtaining a jury and discussing
points of law. On that day, the treason case was
opened, and an examination of witnesses on the part of the
government commenced. On the 1st of September, the
case was given to the jury, and as no overt act was proved
against Colonel Burr to sustain the charge of treason committed
within the state of Virginia, the jury rendered a
verdict of "Not guilty."</p>

<p>On the 9th of September, a jury was empaneled to try
Colonel Burr on the indictment for misdemeanor, which
consisted of seven counts; the substance of which was, that
Aaron Burr did set on foot a military enterprise, to be
carried on against the territory of a foreign prince, viz: the
province of Mexico, which was within the territory of the
king of Spain, with whom the United States were at peace.
After proceeding in the trial at some length, the district
attorney himself moved that the jury should be discharged&mdash;the
evidence of the guilt of the accused not appearing,
sufficient. To a discharge of the jury without the rendition
of a verdict, Burr objected; whereupon the jury retired, and
soon returned with a verdict of "Not guilty."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">[Pg 602]</a></span></p>

<p>The distinguished talents of Colonel Burr, his well-known
cunning and intrigue, and the eminent station he had occupied
in the United States, together with the grave charges
against him of a contemplated dismemberment of the Union,
with other projects&mdash;all combined to attach interest and
importance to his trial. In his message to congress, developing
the designs of Burr, as the government understood
them, President Jefferson accused him of designing to
revolutionize the territory west of the Alleganies, and of
establishing an independent government, of which New
Orleans was to be the capital, and himself the chief. In
addition to this project, Colonel Burr, it was alleged, had
formed another, which, in case of the failure of the first,
might be carried on independent of it, viz: an attack on
Mexico, and an establishment of an empire there. To serve
as a pretext for all his preparations, and an allurement for
such followers as really wished to acquire settlements in
that country, it was stated that a third object was provided&mdash;the
settlement of the pretended purchase of a tract of
land on the Washita, claimed by a Baron Bastrop.</p>

<p>Such were the plans of Burr, according to intelligence
communicated from time to time to the government of the
United States. On the belief of the guilt of Burr, or through
utter hostility to him, Jefferson acted; and with an evident
design to prevent his escape, he succeeded in procuring the
passage of a bill in the senate for suspending the writ of
habeas corpus; but it was rejected by the house, by the
strong vote of one hundred and thirteen to nineteen.</p>

<p>Burr, to his dying day, denied any intention of dismembering
the Union; but avowed the projects which did not
involve the charge of treason. "In his latter days," says
his biographer, "Colonel Burr had no longer any motive for
concealment; nor did he evince the least desire to suppress
the facts in relation to any of his acts, even where the promulgation
of those facts was calculated to effect his moral
character. According to his representation, repeated at a
time, and under circumstances the most solemn and impressive,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603">[Pg 603]</a></span>
(Burr at this time was expected to survive but a short
time,) his views were twofold, viz: <i>First</i>, The revolutionizing
of Mexico; and, <i>Second</i>, A settlement on what was known
as the Bastrop lands."</p>

<p>It is further added by his biographer, that "during the
years 1806 and 1807, Herman Blennerhasset kept a private
journal, in which are recorded the principal incidents arising
out of his connexion with Colonel Burr. Portions of it are
interesting and amusing. The entries confirm the particular
statements of Truxton, Bollman,<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> and others, and repudiate
the idea of treasonable designs. It appears that in December,
1805, Blennerhasset addressed a letter to Colonel Burr,
expressing a wish to participate in any speculation in the
Western country that might present itself to Burr. A
Spanish war was hourly anticipated, and Blennerhasset
proposed to join Burr in any expedition that might be
undertaken against the Spanish dominions.</p>

<p>"In August, 1806, in consequence of this overture, Burr
visited Blannerhasset at his home on the Ohio, and the
next day rode with him to Marietta, and then separated,
Burr being on his way to Chilicothe. From Marietta to
Blannerhasset's was about fifteen miles. Some time after,
Burr returned to Blannerhasset, to whom he said that an
expulsion of the Spaniards from the American territory, or
an invasion of Mexico, would be pleasing to the administration,
if it could be accomplished without an open, formal
war, which would be avoided as long as possible, from
parsimony on the one hand, and the dread of France on
the other."</p>

<p>We have thus given such a statement of this subject as
our limits permit, and as seems due to the respective parties
engaged in it. Different opinions will doubtless be
entertained with reference to Burr's real designs. That he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604">[Pg 604]</a></span>
contemplated the dismemberment of the Union, and the
founding of an empire, of which New Orleans was to be
the centre, and himself the head, will be questioned by some.
That he was capable of devising such a project, and
would have accomplished it, if in his power, no one
acquainted with the deep designing character of the murderer
of Hamilton, can doubt. With exalted talents&mdash;with
an early education and parental counsel, as liberal and
watchful as ever, perhaps, fell to the lot of mortal to enjoy&mdash;with
the favor and patronage of a people, seldom so generously
conferred, or so long and uniformly enjoyed&mdash;Burr
proved himself a selfish, unprincipled man. One thing is
certain, and this he admitted&mdash;that he designed the invasion
and overthrow of the Mexican government, and the
erection of an independent power in its place. And to
further his views, he induced not a few, by "inuendoes
and otherwise," to believe that his arrangements for the
accomplishment of this were with the knowledge, if not the
approbation, of the United States' government.</p>

<p><i>France and England, 1806.</i>&mdash;A contest between these
two powers, which had been waging for some time, and
which had involved the whole of Europe, began now
seriously to affect the commercial interests of America. It
being the obvious policy of the latter to preserve a strict
neutrality in respect to these belligerent powers, every act
of the American government had respect to maintaining
the same. Being neutral, her vessels carried from port to
port the productions of France and her dependent kingdoms;
and also to the ports of those kingdoms, the manufactures
of England, bringing, by means of this "carrying
trade," vast wealth to the nation. These advantages were,
however, too great to be long enjoyed unmolested. American
ships, carrying to Europe the produce of French colonies,
were captured by British cruisers, and condemned by
their courts as lawful prizes; and now, several European
ports, under the control of France, were, by British orders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605">[Pg 605]</a></span>
in council, May 16, 1806, declared to be in a state of
blockade, although not invested with a British fleet; and
American vessels, attempting to enter those ports, were also
captured and condemned. France and her allies suffered
from these proceedings, but far less than the United States.
By way of retaliation, in November of the same year,
Buonaparte issued a decree at <i>Berlin</i>, declaring the British
islands to be in a state of blockade, and of course authorizing
the capture and condemnation of all neutral vessels
attempting to trade with them. Thus, from the retaliatory
measures of these two rival powers, the commerce of the
United States was seriously injured.</p>

<p>Although the relations of Great Britain and America
were at this time ostensibly pacific, yet there existed, and
had long existed, a claim on the part of Great Britain, and
a pretence under that claim, which was denied by the several
presidents during their administrations. This was
what was denominated "the right of search"&mdash;founded
upon the English principle, that no act of a subject can
change his allegiance to the government under which he
was born. Upon this principle, Great Britain, soon after
the peace of 1783, claimed the right to board and search
neutral vessels, and take therefrom all British seamen found
therein. In the exercise of this pretended right, citizens
of the United States had been seized, and, being transported
to a distant part of the world, had been compelled
to perform the degrading part of British sailors. Notwithstanding
the remonstrances of Washington, Adams, and
Jefferson, the odious practice was still continued, and every
year was adding to its aggravations.</p>

<p><i>Attack on the Chesapeake.</i>&mdash;At length, an event occurred,
growing out of this pretended "right of search," which
roused the indignation of the American people.</p>

<p>A British armed ship, called the Melampus, while lying
in Hampton roads, lost, by desertion, several of her crew,
viz: William Ware, Daniel Martin, John Strachan, John<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606">[Pg 606]</a></span>
Little, and Ambrose Watts. Not long after, the first three
offered themselves for enlistment on board the Chesapeake,
then at Norfolk, Virginia, preparing for the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>The British consul at Norfolk; being apprised of this
circumstance, wrote a letter to the American naval officer,
requesting these men to be returned. With this request
the officer refusing to comply, the British agent requested
an order from government for their surrender. An examination,
however, into the characters and claims of the
men in question, resulted in proof that Ware, Martin, and
Strachan, were natives of America. The two former had
<i>protections</i>, or notarial certificates of their being American
citizens. Strachan had no <i>protection</i>, but asserted
that he lost it previously to his escape. Such being the
circumstances of the men, the government refused to
surrender them.</p>

<p>On the 22d of June, the Chesapeake weighed anchor, and
proceeded to sea. She passed the British ships Bellona
and Melampus, lying in Lynnhaven bay. There were two
ships lying off Cape Henry, one of which, the Leopard,
Captain Humphreys, weighed anchor, and, in a few hours,
came alongside the Chesapeake.</p>

<p>A British officer immediately came on board, and
demanded the deserters. To this, Captain Barron replied,
that he did not know of any being there, and that his duty
forbade him to allow of any muster of his crew, except by
their own officers.</p>

<p>During this interview, Barron, noticing some proceedings
of a hostile nature on board the adverse ship, gave orders,
on the departure of the officer, to clear his gun-deck, and,
after some time, directed his men to their quarters secretly,
and without beat of drum; still, however, without any
serious apprehensions of an attack.</p>

<p>Before these orders could be executed, the Leopard commenced
a heavy fire, which proved very destructive. In
thirty minutes, the hull, rigging, and spars of the Chesapeake
were greatly damaged; three men were killed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">[Pg 607]</a></span>
sixteen wounded; among the latter, was the captain
himself. Such was the previous disorder, that, during this
time, the utmost exertions were insufficient to prepare the
ship for action, and the captain thought proper to strike
his colors.</p>

<p>The British captain refused to accept the surrender of
the Chesapeake, but took from her crew Ware, Martin,
and Strachan, the three men formerly demanded as deserters,
and a fourth, John Wilson, claimed as a runaway from
a merchant ship.</p>

<p>"On receiving information of this outrage, the president,
by proclamation, interdicted the harbors and waters of the
United States to all armed British vessels, forbade intercourse
with them, and ordered a sufficient force for the
protection of Norfolk, and such other preparations as the
occasion appeared to require. An armed vessel of the
United States was dispatched, with instructions to the
American minister at London, to call on the British government
for the satisfaction and security which the outrage
required."</p>

<p>Pursuant to these instructions, Mr. Monroe, then minister
resident at the court of St. James, demanded reparation;
and, as an essential part of that reparation, security against
future impressments from American ships. But Mr. Canning,
the British minister, objected to uniting these subjects,
and Mr. Monroe not being authorized to treat them separately,
Mr. Rose was dispatched, by the English government,
as envoy extraordinary to the United States, to adjust the
difficulty which had arisen on account of the Chesapeake.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">[Pg 608]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Orders in Council.</i>&mdash;In November, Great Britain issued
her orders in council, which measure she declared to be in
retaliation of the French decree of November, 1806. By
these orders, all neutral nations were prohibited from trading
with France or her allies, excepting upon the payment of a
tribute to England.</p>

<p><i>Milan Decree.</i>&mdash;Scarcely had the news of the adoption
of the above orders reached Milan, where Buonaparte then
was, than he issued, December 17th, a retaliatory decree,
called the "Milan Decree," which confiscated any and
every vessel found in any of his ports, which had allowed
herself to be searched by an English ship, or had paid the
tribute demanded.</p>

<p><i>Embargo.</i>&mdash;Congress had been summoned, by proclamation
of the president, to meet as early as the 27th of
October. The wanton attack upon the Chesapeake had
filled the country with indignation&mdash;all parties felt the
national honor insulted; forgetting, for the time, political
jealousies and animosities, all concurred in demanding satisfaction
for the outrage.</p>

<p>There were other subjects, also, which, in the opinion of
the executive, required the thoughtful consideration of the
national legislature. The conduct of the continental belligerents
was preying upon the vital interests of America.
Great Britain was asserting rights which could never be
allowed, and assuming a lofty tone which would excite no
other feelings but indignation.</p>

<p>In view of the circumstances of the country, the president
recommended to congress to lay an embargo&mdash;by
which measure he designed to detain seamen, ships, and
merchandise in port, to preserve them from the dangers to
which they were exposed on the ocean; but the higher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_609" id="Page_609">[Pg 609]</a></span>
motive for recommending such a measure, probably, was
the hope of thereby inducing&mdash;coercing, we might with
more truth say&mdash;the belligerent powers to respect the laws
of nations. In accordance with the recommendation of the
president, an embargo was laid.</p>

<p>This measure was not without its commercial and political
effects. The large shipping interest then in the
United States was locked up by means of it, and vessels
abroad, which were obliged to come in, could go out no
more. To the New England states, which were prëeminently
commercial, the embargo was highly obnoxious.
They believed the measure both impolitic and oppressive.</p>

<p>A rapid change in the political opinions of the people of
New England was the consequence. A large majority,
embracing many who had supported the administration,
now united with the federal party, and opposed its measures
with zeal. Thus pressed by public sentiment, the
government felt the necessity of repealing the embargo,
which it was the more willing to do, from the consideration
that it had failed to effect its principal object; but, at the
same time, another law was passed, prohibiting all intercourse
with France and Great Britain for one year. "Provision
was made in this law, that, should either of the
hostile nations revoke her edict, so that the neutral commerce
of the United States should be no longer violated,
the president should immediately make it known by proclamation,
and, from that time, the non-intercourse law should
cease to be enforced as it regarded that nation."</p>

<p><i>Election of Mr. Madison.</i>&mdash;In this critical posture of
affairs, the period having again arrived for the election of
president, Mr. Jefferson signified his determination to follow
and confirm the example of Washington, by retiring to private
life at the expiration of his second term. "Never did
a prisoner," said he, "released from his chains, feel such
relief as I shall, on shaking off the shackles of power. I
thank God for the opportunity of retiring from them without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_610" id="Page_610">[Pg 610]</a></span>
censure, and carrying with me the most constant proofs
of public approbation. I leave every thing in the hands of
men so able to take care of them, that, if we are destined
to meet misfortunes, it will be because no human wisdom
could avert them." James Madison was chosen his successor,
and George Clinton rëelected vice-president. The

<p>In his address, delivered on the occasion of his inauguration,
Mr. Madison alluded to "the present situation of the
world as without a parallel, and that of the United States
as full of difficulties." The two leading powers of Europe,
France and England, were still engaged in arraying against
each other commercial edicts, which tended directly to
destroy the commerce of nations disposed to pursue a
neutral policy. The United States, moreover, were suffering
by means of restrictions upon their commerce, imposed
by the federal government. The condition of the people,
especially the commercial portion of it, was gloomy and
depressing. A vast amount of capital, invested in shipping,
was lying idle, and rapidly diminishing in value. Neither
the embargo nor non-intercourse had had the effect to induce
either of the belligerent powers to pause in their wanton
and unjust restrictions and decrees. On the contrary, their
obnoxious measures were growing oppressive every month.
The patience of the United States' government was nearly
exhausted. Every thing betokened a speedy resort to arms.</p>

<p>The principal events and measures which subsequently
signalized the administration of Mr. Madison, were as

<p><i>Battle of Tippecanoe.</i>&mdash;This battle, fought on the 7th of
November, 1811, was doubtless one of the most spirited and
best-fought actions recorded in the annals of Indian warfare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_613" id="Page_613">[Pg 613]</a></span></p>

<p>For several years, the Indian tribes on our Western frontier
had exhibited a restless and hostile spirit, engendered
by the intrigues of two twin-brothers of the Shawnee tribe,
Tecumseh, the <i>Crouching Panther</i>, and Ol-li-wa-chi-ca, the
<i>Open Door</i>, generally known as the Prophet. The former
was a bold and skillful warrior, sagacious in council, and
formidable in battle; the latter was cunning, cruel, cowardly,
and treacherous.</p>

<p>One important object of these brothers, was to form a
general combination of the north-western and south-western
Indians, for the purpose of preventing the whites from
extending their settlements west of those already existing,
and perhaps of recovering the valley of the Mississippi&mdash;a
territory which, from its great fertility, they naturally and
strongly desired to possess.</p>

<p>The plans of the brothers were, from time to time, communicated
to General Harrison, then governor of the north-west
territory, by his confidential advisers; and, for several
years, by his forbearance and wise policy, he was enabled
to counteract those plans, without exciting their jealousy or
increasing their hostility.</p>

<p>In September, 1809, General Harrison held a council at
Fort Wayne, where he negotiated a treaty with the Miamies
and several other Indian tribes, by which they sold to the
United States a large tract of country on both sides of the
Wabash, extending up that river more than sixty miles
above Vincennes.</p>

<p>At the time this treaty was negotiated, Tecumseh was absent,
but his brother, the Prophet, who was present, made
objection to it; but, on the return of the former, he expressed
great dissatisfaction, and even threatened to put to death
those chiefs who had signed the treaty. From this time,
no efforts of General Harrison availed to pacify the
brothers, or to quiet the restless and hostile feelings of their
followers. At length, the Indians proceeded to the perpetration
of deeds of depredation and murder; the white
population of the frontier became excited and alarmed. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_614" id="Page_614">[Pg 614]</a></span>
this state of things, General Harrison, by order of the president,
assembled five hundred of the militia and volunteers
of Indiana, and with these, increased by a regiment of
United States' infantry, consisting of three hundred and
fifty men, and a small but gallant body of volunteers from
Kentucky, took post at Fort Harrison, sixty miles above
Vincennes; whence, not long after, he proceeded, October
28th, 1811, to the Prophet's town. At the distance of nine
or ten miles, the army encamped on the evening of the 5th
of November.</p>

<p>On the following day, the army proceeded towards the
town in the order of battle; and when arrived within a
short distance, they were met by a deputation of the
Prophet's counsellors. "They were sent," they said, "to
ascertain why an army was advancing upon them, and to
avert, if possible, approaching hostilities. This was the
wish of the Prophet himself." A suspension of hostilities
was agreed upon, for the purpose of an interview between
the governor and chiefs, to be held the following day.</p>

<p>The ensuing night was dark and cloudy. The moon
rose late, and soon after midnight there commenced a light
fall of drizzling rain. The night, however, passed without
interruption, and the governor and his aids rose at a quarter
to four, and were sitting in conversation before a fire.
It was still dark, as the light of the moon was shadowed by
heavy and lowering clouds. At this moment, an attack by
the Indians was commenced. They had stealthily crept up
near the sentries, with the intention of rushing upon them,
and killing them before they could give the alarm. But,
fortunately, one of them discovered an Indian creeping
towards him through the grass, and fired at him. This was
immediately followed by the Indian yell, and a furious
charge upon the left flank. The camp-fires were immediately
extinguished, as their light only served to expose our
men to the deadly aim of the Indians. Upon the first alarm,
the governor mounted his horse, and proceeded to the point
of attack; and, finding the line there much weakened, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_615" id="Page_615">[Pg 615]</a></span>
ordered two companies from the centre and rear line to
march to their support. About this time, the gallant Colonel
Daviess, of Kentucky, in attempting to dislodge some
Indians concealed behind some trees, was shot down, being
pierced with three balls, either of which would have proved
fatal. His men repulsed the Indians several times, and
finally succeeded in carrying him into the camp. Colonel
Isaac White, of Indiana, another brave officer, who served
as a volunteer under Colonel Daviess, likewise fell in this
sanguinary charge. About the same time, Colonel Owen,
aid to Governor Harrison, was also killed.</p>

   <img src="images/illus-618.jpg" alt="TIPPECANOE." title="TIPPECANOE."/>
</div>

<p>"The battle was now maintained in every direction with
desperate valor. The Indians advanced and retreated by
a rattling noise, made with deer-hoofs. They fought with
great enthusiasm, and seemed determined to conquer.</p>

<p>"When the day dawned, the left flank, the most assailable
part of the encampment, was rëinforced by four companies,
drawn from the rear and centre; the right flank
was strengthened by two companies; the dragoons were
mounted, and, supported by them, a simultaneous charge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_616" id="Page_616">[Pg 616]</a></span>
was made upon the enemy on both flanks; and so vigorous
and determined was the attack, that the enemy gave way on
all sides. The Indians, on the left flank, were driven into a
swamp, impenetrable to cavalry, while those on the right
were put to flight with great loss, and this severely-contested
victory was at last gained by our gallant troops."<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>The Indians engaged in this battle were supposed to
amount to one thousand. They were led by three distinguished
warriors&mdash;<i>White Loomstone Eater</i>, and <i>Winnemac</i>&mdash;the
last a Potawattomie chief, who had made great
professions of friendship to General Harrison himself.
Tecumseh was not present at the battle, being on a visit to
more southern tribes, the object of which was supposed to be
to enlist them in a common cause against the United States.
As for the Prophet, he took no active part in the engagement,
but employed himself in chanting a war-song from a
neighboring eminence. When it was announced to him
that the tide was setting strongly against his warriors, and
that they were falling on every side, his only response was
"to fight on, and that they would soon see the fulfillment of
all his predictions."</p>

<p>A melancholy duty followed the battle&mdash;that of burying
their brave companions, who had fallen on the field. This
done, and the wounded provided for, the army took up their
march from the scene of carnage, and returned to Vincennes.
The results of the engagement were important.
The haughty and discontented spirit of the Indians was
humbled, and the plan which they had devised, and which
had nearly ripened to maturity, of attacking and destroying
the scattered border settlements, was defeated.</p>

<p><i>Early Session of Congress.</i>&mdash;On the 5th of November,
1811, President Madison summoned a meeting of congress.
His message indicating an apprehension of hostilities with
Great Britain, the committee of foreign relations in the
house of representatives reported resolutions for filling up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_617" id="Page_617">[Pg 617]</a></span>
the ranks of the army; for raising an additional force of
ten thousand men; for authorizing the president to accept
the services of fifty thousand volunteers, and for ordering
out the militia when he should judge it necessary; for
repairing the navy, and for authorizing the arming of merchantmen
in self-defence. A bill from the senate, for
raising twenty-five thousand men, after much discussion,
was also agreed to by the house.</p>

<p><i>Declaration of War.</i>&mdash;Preparations in anticipation of
war were now industriously urged; yet the hope was still
cherished, until May in the following year, that a change
of policy in Europe would render unnecessary an appeal
to arms. Towards the close of that season, the Hornet
arrived from London, bringing information that no prospect
existed of a favorable change. On the 1st of June, the
president sent a message to congress, recounting the wrongs
received from Great Britain, and submitting the question,
whether the United States should continue to endure them,
or resort to war? The message was considered with
closed doors. On the 18th, an act was passed, declaring
war against Great Britain; soon after which, the president
issued his proclamation making public announcement of
the same.</p>

<p><i>Surrender of Hull.</i>&mdash;At the time of the declaration of
war, General Hull was at Dayton, in Ohio, with a small
American force, destined for Detroit. This having been
subsequently increased to two thousand five hundred men,
on the 12th of July he crossed into Canada, and taking
post at Sandwich, issued from that place a proclamation,
couched in bold and imposing language. By means of it,
the Indians were awed into neutrality, and the Canadians,
favorable to the American cause, either remained quietly at
home or joined his ranks.</p>

<p>On the 1st of August, intelligence was received by the
American general of the fall of the fortress at Mackinaw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_618" id="Page_618">[Pg 618]</a></span>
on the 17th of July. Until the moment of a demand to
surrender, no intelligence had been received by the garrison
of the declaration of war. This event justly filled
Hull with surprise and consternation, as he had now no
means of checking the incursions of the restless hordes of
northern savages.</p>

<p>On the 5th of August, a council of war was held, to
deliberate upon the expediency of attacking the fortress of
Malden; but as the artillery had not arrived, it was decided
to wait two days, and then proceed with or without it, as
the case might be.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, however, communications were received
from Generals Porter and Hall, who commanded on the
Niagara frontier, that the enemy were leaving their posts
in that quarter, and were concentrating their forces at
Malden. At the same time, Hull was informed that he
could not depend upon assistance from General Dearborn,
the commander-in-chief, although the latter had been
directed by the government to invade Canada from Niagara,
and cöoperate with Hull. Under all the aspects of the
case, although his delayed artillery had arrived, Hull issued
orders, on the afternoon of the 7th, for his army to return
to Detroit.</p>

<p>An order to the officers and army so unexpected as this&mdash;at
a moment when they were anticipating a victory and
the honors due from it&mdash;was like a thunderbolt upon them.
The murmurs of the volunteers and regular troops were
loud. They upbraided their commander with pusillanimity,
and even treachery.</p>

<p>On the 14th, a British force, under command of General
Brock, the most active and able of the British commanders
in Canada, took a position opposite Detroit, where
they proceeded to erect batteries. On the 15th, he sent a
flag, bearing a summons to the American general to surrender,
in which he says: "It is far from my intention to join
in a war of extermination, but you must be aware that the
numerous body of Indians, who have attached themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_619" id="Page_619">[Pg 619]</a></span>
to my troops, will be beyond my control the moment the
contest commences." To this, General Hull answered: "I
have no other reply to make, than that I am prepared to
meet any force which may be at your disposal," &amp;c. General
Brock immediately opened his batteries upon the
town and fort, and several persons within the fort were
killed. The fire was returned by the Americans with
some effect.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 16th, the British crossed the river,
and landing, under cover of their ships, at Spring Wells,
three miles below Detroit, commenced their march towards
the fort. Hull, it was evident, was perplexed and agitated.
At first, his army was drawn up in order of battle without
the fort, his artillery advantageously planted, and his troops
impatiently waiting the approach of the enemy. At length,
when the British were within five hundred yards of their
lines, most suddenly and unexpectedly an order from General
Hull was received, directing them "to retire immediately
to the fort."</p>

<p>No sooner were the troops in the fort, than they were
further directed to stack their arms&mdash;immediately after
which, a white flag was suspended from the walls, in token
of submission. A British officer rode up to ascertain the
cause, for this surrender was no less unexpected to the
assailants. A capitulation was agreed to, without even
stipulating the terms. Words are wanting to express the
feelings of the Americans, in being thus compelled to surrender
to an inferior force, without firing a gun, when they
were firmly convinced that that force was in their power.
The British took immediate possession of the fort, with all
the public property it contained; among which were forty
barrels of powder, four hundred rounds of fixed twenty-four-pound
shot, one hundred thousand ball cartridges, two
thousand five hundred stand of arms, twenty-five pieces of
iron cannon and eight of brass, the greater number of
which had been captured by the Americans during the
revolutionary war. Besides this great amount of warlike<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_620" id="Page_620">[Pg 620]</a></span>
stores, the whole territory, forts and garrisons were also
delivered up.</p>

<p>In his official dispatch, General Hull labored to free his
conduct from censure, by bringing into view the inferiority
of his force, compared with that of the enemy; and, also,
the dangers which threatened him from numerous western
tribes of Indians. But whether the views which induced
this surrender were in reality justly founded or not, the
public mind was altogether unprepared for an occurrence
at once so disastrous and mortifying.</p>

<p>Some time after, having been exchanged, Hull was
arraigned before a court-martial, of which General Dearborn
was president. By this tribunal, he was acquitted of
treason, but sentenced to death for cowardice and unofficer-like
conduct. In consideration, however, of his revolutionary
services, and the recommendation of the court, the
president remitted the punishment of death, but deprived
him of all military command.</p>

<p><i>Constitution and Guerriere.</i>&mdash;While defeat and disgrace
were attending the American arms on the land, the ocean
was the theatre of bold and successful achievement on the
part of the American navy. On the 19th of August, three
days after the disgraceful surrender of Detroit, the Constitution
achieved a splendid victory over the Guerriere. On
the 2d of August, the Constitution put to sea. On the 19th,
a vessel hove in sight, which proved to be the Guerriere,
and the Constitution bore down upon her. "At first, it was
the intention of Captain Hull to bring her to close action
immediately; but, on coming within gun-shot, she gave a
broadside, and filled away; then wore, giving a broadside
on the other tack, but without effect. They now continued
wearing and man&#339;uvring on both sides, for three-quarters
of an hour, the Guerriere attempting to take a raking position;
but, failing in this, she bore up, and run with her top-sail
and jib on the quarter. The Constitution, perceiving
this, made sail to come up with her. Captain Hull, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_621" id="Page_621">[Pg 621]</a></span>
admirable coolness, received the enemy's fire without
returning it. The enemy, mistaking this conduct on the
part of the American commander for want of skill, continued
to pour out his broadsides with a view to cripple
his antagonist. From the Constitution, not a gun had
been fired. Already had an officer twice come on deck,
with information that several of the men had been killed,
at their guns. The gallant crew, burning with impatience,
silently awaited the orders of their commander. The
moment so long looked for, at last arrived. Sailing-master
Aylwin having seconded the views of the captain
with admirable skill, in bringing the vessel exactly to the
station intended, orders were given at five minutes before
five P. M., to fire broadside after broadside, in quick succession.
The crew instantly discovered the whole plan,
and entered into it with all the spirit that the circumstances
were calculated to inspire. Never was any firing so dreadful.
For fifteen minutes the vivid lightning of the Constitution's
guns continued one blaze, and their thunder roared
with scarce an intermission. The enemy's mizen-mast had
gone by the board, and he stood exposed to a raking fire
which swept his decks. The Guerriere had now become
unmanageable; her hull, rigging, and sails, dreadfully torn;
when the Constitution attempted to lay her on board. At
this moment, Lieutenant Bush, in attempting to throw his
marines on board, was killed by a musket-ball, and the
enemy shot ahead, but could not be brought before the
wind. A raking fire now continued for fifteen minutes
longer, when his main-mast and fore-mast went, taking
with them every spar excepting the bowsprit. On seeing
this, the firing ceased, and at twenty-five minutes past five,
she surrendered. "In thirty minutes" says Captain Hull,
"after we got fairly alongside of the enemy, she surrendered,
and had not a spar standing, and her hull, above and
below water, so shattered, that a few more broadsides must
have carried her down." The Guerriere was so much
damaged, as to render it impossible to bring her in; she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_622" id="Page_622">[Pg 622]</a></span>
was therefore set fire to the next day, and blown up. The
damage sustained by the Constitution was comparatively of
so little consequence, that she actually made ready for
action when a vessel appeared in sight the next day. The
loss on board the Guerriere, was fifteen killed and sixty-three
wounded: on the side of the Constitution, seven killed
and seven wounded. It is pleasing to observe, that even
the British commander, on this occasion, bore testimony to
the humanity and generosity with which he was treated by
the victors. The American frigate was superior in force
by a few guns, but this difference bore no comparison to
the disparity of the conflict. The Guerriere was thought
to be a match for any vessel of her class, and had been
ranked among the largest in the British navy. The Constitution
arrived at Boston on the 28th of August, having
captured several merchant vessels."<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>The victory thus achieved was of incalculable importance
to the Americans. If unexpected and surprising to them, it
was still more so to the English. On the ocean, the latter
claimed supremacy; and their successes in respect to other
nations seemed to justify their proud pretensions. Indeed,
whatever might be the result of the contest on the land, it
had scarcely occurred to the English, that the Americans
could, in any equal engagement on the water, become the
victors. Nor had the Americans themselves confident
hope of any signal success. But this beginning diffused a
general joy throughout the nation, as well it might, and
excited anticipations which, if high, were destined to be
more than realized.</p>

<p><i>Battle of Queenstown.</i>&mdash;For the purpose of invading Canada,
an army of about five thousand New York militia had
been collected on the Niagara frontier. Of these, General
Stephen Van Rensselaer, of Albany, an officer of great
merit, had the command. His head-quarters were at Lewiston,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_623" id="Page_623">[Pg 623]</a></span>
on the river Niagara, opposite to which was Queenstown,
a fortified British post. Several hundred regular
troops were also attached to his command.</p>

<p>The militia displaying great eagerness to attack the
enemy, the general determined to give them an opportunity
by crossing over to Queenstown. On the morning of the
13th, the army having been rëinforced by three hundred
regulars, under Colonel Christie, the passage of the Niagara
was made. One division of the troops was commanded
by Colonel Solomon Van Rensselaer; the other, was the
division of Colonel Christie. These were to be followed
by Colonel Fenwick's artillery, and the residue of the
army. The first party which effected a landing, was that
of Colonels Van Rensselaer and Christie, about four
o'clock in the morning. On landing, the detachments
were formed by order of Colonel Van Rensselaer, (Colonel
Christie not having crossed with his men,) for the purpose
of storming the heights of Queenstown.</p>

<p>At this critical moment, the American troops were
attacked on either flank, during which the brave Colonel
Van Rensselaer received four severe wounds, which were
then supposed to be mortal. The command now devolved
upon Captain Wool, the senior officer of the regular troops,
who, although sorely wounded, repaired to Van Rensselaer,
and volunteered for any service which might relieve the
troops of the latter. Colonel Van Rensselaer directed the
storming of the British battery upon the heights. Wool
immediately conducted his force silently and circuitously,
leaving the battery to his right, until he had passed it, and
attained an eminence which commanded it. The British,
finding that resistance would not avail them any thing, left
it to the Americans, and retreated down the heights of
Queenstown.</p>

<p>Elated with their success, the Americans had fallen into
disorder, when suddenly they beheld the intrepid Brock
advancing at the head of a rëinforcement of about three
hundred men from Fort George. In a moment of alarm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_624" id="Page_624">[Pg 624]</a></span>
an officer raised a white flag, in token of surrender, but
which Wool indignantly pulled down. To keep the enemy
at bay, until he could form his men, he dispatched a body
of sixty men, who advanced, but retreated without firing a
gun. The British followed, and drove the Americans to
the brink of the precipice. One soldier, who was about to
descend, Wool ordered to be shot; but, as the musket was
levelling, he returned. Thus prohibiting either surrender
or retreat, and being ably seconded by his officers, Wool
rallied, and led on his troops to the attack. The British, in
their turn, gave way, and retreated down the hill. Brock,
in attempting to rally them amidst a galling fire from the
Americans, was mortally wounded. His party no longer
attempted resistance, but fled in disorder.</p>

<p>The Americans were now congratulating themselves on
their success, when, unexpectedly, they were attacked by
a body of British and Indians, amounting to one thousand,
under General Sheaffe, who had followed the energetic
Brock from Fort George. The battle becoming warm, and
the Americans being hard pressed, General Van Rensselaer
rëcrossed the Niagara, for the purpose of bringing over the
militia, who were on the opposite bank.</p>

<p>But their ardor had abated. The sight of the wounded,
and the groans of the dying, who most unfortunately had
been carried in boats to the American side, had served to
destroy all their courage. They could not be persuaded to
cross, although their gallant general besought them with
tears. Two thousand and five hundred of the militia, quite
sufficient to have maintained the works which had been
taken, remained idle and cowardly spectators of this most
interesting scene. For this conduct, they found an excuse
in the unconstitutionality of obliging militia to enter a
foreign territory for the purpose of aggressive war. Thus
the day was lost, and the troops, who had fought so nobly,
had fought in vain, and were obliged, at length, to surrender.
Sixty were killed, one hundred wounded, and seven
hundred made prisoners.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_625" id="Page_625">[Pg 625]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Wasp and Frolic.</i>&mdash;On the 13th of October, the American
sloop-of-war Wasp, mounting sixteen thirty-two-pound
carronades, two long twelves, with one hundred and
thirty men, left the Delaware on a cruise. On the night
of the 17th, several sail were discovered, which, in the
morning, proved to be English merchantmen from Honduras,
under convoy of a brig and two ships, armed with
sixteen guns each. The brig shortened sail, with an evident
disposition for an engagement.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Wasp having prepared for action, ranged
close up on the starboard side of the enemy, receiving her
broadside at the distance of some sixty yards, and delivering
her own. From this moment, the action became unremitted.
The fire of the Frolic, for so she proved to be,
was to that of the Wasp, as three to two; but with this
remarkable difference, that while the former uniformly fired
as she rose, the sea being rough, the latter as uniformly
fired when she sunk. And the consequence was, that the
shot of the Frolic were either lost, or only touched the rigging
of the Wasp, while those from the latter struck the hull
of her antagonist.</p>

<p>In the brief space of five minutes, the maintop-mast of
the Wasp was shot away, and, falling down with the maintop-sail
yard across the larboard fore and foretop-sail, rendered
her head yards unmanageable during the rest of the
action. Soon after, her gaff and mizen-gallant-masts were
shot away.</p>

<p>Perceiving the desolating effect of the enemy's fire upon
his spars and rigging, Captain Jones at first decided to
board; but, soon after, finding his ship in a favorable position
to rake, he directed a fresh broadside to be delivered.
The vessels had gradually approached, and were now so
near, that in loading some of the guns of the Wasp, the
rammers hit against the bows of her antagonist, and the
men of the Frolic could no longer be kept at their quarters
forward. The discharge of one or two carronades swept
the enemy's decks. The impetuosity of the Wasp's crew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_626" id="Page_626">[Pg 626]</a></span>
could be no longer restrained, and they began to leap into
the rigging, and from thence on to the bowsprit of the brig.
In this movement, however, they were preceded by Mr.
Biddle, the first lieutenant. On reaching the deck, judge
his surprise, only three officers and a seaman at the wheel
were to be seen! The bodies of the slain were lying here
and there, and the deck was slippery with blood.</p>

<p>The colors were still flying, there being no seaman to
pull them down. This grateful service was performed by
Mr. Biddle himself. The officers now stepped forward, and
surrendered their swords in submission. Thus, in forty-three
minutes, possession was taken of the Frolic, after one
of the most bloody conflicts recorded in naval history.</p>

<p>The Frolic was commanded by Captain Whinyates. She
mounted on her main deck sixteen thirty-two-pound carronades,
four long guns, differently stated to be sixes, nines,
and twelves, with two twelve-pound carronades on a top-gallant
forecastle. The Wasp had five killed and five
wounded. Her hull sustained but trifling injury. The loss
of the Frolic was seventy or eighty in wounded and killed.
Both these vessels were captured the same day by the
Poictiers, seventy-four, and taken to Bermuda.</p>

<p>This and other naval victories, while they served to
animate and gratify the whole American people, were
humbling to the pride of Great Britain. She had made
her boast that she would drive our "bits of striped bunting"
from the ocean; but she found herself mistaken; nor was a
committee of investigation able to solve the mystery, except
that the American frigates were seventy-fours in disguise!</p>

<p><i>United States and Macedonian.</i>&mdash;The capture of the
Frolic was almost immediately succeeded by the capture,
off the Western Isles, October 25th, of the British frigate
Macedonian, mounting forty-nine carriage-guns, by the
American frigate United States, forty-four guns. The former
was commanded by Captain John S. Carden; the latter
by Captain Stephen Decatur.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_627" id="Page_627">[Pg 627]</a></span></p>

<p>The engagement, from its commencement, lasted for
nearly an hour and a half&mdash;the early part being occupied
in firing long-shot; but it was terminated in a very short
period, after the vessels came into close action. For a
time, the advantage of position was with the Macedonian;
but, notwithstanding this, the fire of the Americans was so
superior, that, in a brief space, the mizen-mast, fore and
maintop-mast, and main-yard of the enemy, were cut down;
besides receiving not less than one hundred round shot in
her hull. Of her crew, three hundred in number, thirty-six
were killed, and sixty-eight wounded.</p>

<p>The damage sustained by the United States was comparatively
small. She lost one of her top-gallant-masts,
received some wounds in her spars, had a good deal of rigging
cut, but was hulled only a few times. Of her officers
and crew, five were killed and seven wounded.</p>

<p>The manner in which the brave Decatur received Captain
Carden on board the United States did him great honor.
When the latter presented his sword, as in such cases is
usual, the former assured him that "he could not think of
taking the sword of an officer who had defended his
ship so gallantly, but he should be happy to take him
by the hand."</p>

<p>The United States, after the action, was in a condition to
pursue her course; but, desirous of securing a prize so valuable
as the Macedonian, Captain Decatur determined to
make the attempt, notwithstanding her disabled state.
Accordingly, having made such repairs upon her as circumstances
allowed, the two ships made the best of their
way to the United States.</p>

<p>The Macedonian was a fine ship of her class. She was
smaller, of lighter armament, and had fewer men than the
United States; but the disproportion between the force
of the two vessels was much less than between the
execution.</p>

<p>The reputation of Captain Decatur, already high, was
added to by the manner in which the Macedonian was captured;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_628" id="Page_628">[Pg 628]</a></span>
and another testimony was added to the skill and
bravery of the naval officers of the United States.</p>

<p>If such warfare must be&mdash;yet it is gloomy to think of it
among rational and immortal beings, made of one blood, and
having one common destiny&mdash;it may not be criminal, perhaps,
to desire that our country's cause should be crowned
with success, if that cause be just.</p>

<p><i>Constitution and Java.</i>&mdash;The naval campaign of 1812
closed with another American victory, equal in brilliancy
to any which had preceded. On the 29th of December, a
few leagues west of St. Salvador, on the coast of Brazil,
the Constitution, now under command of Commodore
Bainbridge, descried the British frigate Java, forty-nine
guns, and four hundred men, commanded by Captain Lambert.
Both vessels, for some time, man&#339;uvred to obtain a
position that would enable them to rake, or avoid being
raked. In the early part of the engagement, the wheel of
the Constitution was shot away. Commodore Bainbridge
determined to close with the British vessel, notwithstanding,
in so doing, he should expose his ship to be several times
raked. He ordered the fore and main-sails to be set, and
luffed up close to the enemy, in such a manner that his jib-boom
got foul of the Constitution's mizen-rigging. About
three o'clock, the head of the British vessel's bowsprit and
jib-boom were shot away; and, in the space of an hour,
her fore-mast was shot away by the board, her main-topmast
just above the cap, her gaff and spanker-boom, and
her main-mast nearly by the board.</p>

<p>About four o'clock, the fire of the British vessel being
completely silenced, and her colors in the main rigging being
down, she was supposed to have struck. The courses of
the Constitution were now hauled on board, to shoot ahead,
in order to repair her rigging, which was very much cut.
The British vessel was left a complete wreck. Her flag
was soon after discovered to be still flying. The Constitution,
however, hove to, to repair some of her damages.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_629" id="Page_629">[Pg 629]</a></span>
About a quarter of an hour after, the main-mast of the
British vessel went by the board. About three-quarters of
an hour after four, the Constitution wore, and stood for the
British vessel, and got close athwart her bows, in a very
effectual position for raking, when she prudently struck her
flag. The Constitution had nine men killed and twenty-five
wounded; the Java had sixty killed and one hundred and
twenty wounded. Captain Lambert was mortally wounded.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="illus-632.jpg" id="illus-632.jpg"></a>
   <img src="images/illus-632.jpg" alt="CONSTITUTION &amp; JAVA." title="CONSTITUTION &amp; JAVA."/>
</div>

<p>The great distance from the United States, and the disabled
state of the Java, forbade every idea of attempting
to bring her to the United States. No alternative was
therefore left but to burn her, which was done, after the
prisoners and their baggage were removed to the Constitution.
They were all landed at St. Salvador, and paroled.
The commander of the Java, Captain Lambert, died soon
after he was put on shore.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Aylwin, of the Constitution, was severely
wounded during the action. When the boarders were
called to repel boarders, he mounted the quarter-deck hammock-cloth,
and, in the act of firing his pistol at the enemy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_630" id="Page_630">[Pg 630]</a></span>
received a ball through his shoulder. Notwithstanding the
severity of his wound, he continued at his post until the
enemy struck. He died, however, on the 28th of January,
at sea.</p>

<p><i>Close of the Campaign of 1812.</i>&mdash;The naval victories,
which have been noticed, were peculiarly gratifying to the
Americans; the more so, from the humiliating fact that, on
the land, not a single achievement had been made worthy
the American valor. Not one victory had been gained
which lasted&mdash;nor one foot of territory acquired, of which
possession was retained. But the navy had triumphed.
The victories gained, were by that class of citizens whose
rights had been violated; and over a nation, whose long-continued
success had led them to consider themselves lords
of the sea. Many British merchantmen were also captured,
both by the American navy and by privateers. The number
of prizes, made during the first seven months of the
war, exceeded five hundred.</p>

<p><i>Campaign of 1813.</i>&mdash;The scene of the campaign of
1813, comprehended the whole northern frontier of the
United States. The army of the West, under General
Harrison, was stationed near the head of Lake Erie; the
army of the centre, under General Dearborn, between
Lakes Ontario and Erie; and the army of the North, under
General Hampton, occupied the shores of Lake Champlain.
The invasion of Canada was the grand project of the
campaign. The British forces in Canada were under the
general command of Sir George Prevost. The defence of
the Upper Provinces was committed to Colonels Procter
and Vincent; that of the Lower Provinces was entrusted
to General Sheaffe.</p>

<p><i>Battle of Frenchtown.</i>&mdash;Michigan, of which Detroit was
the prominent town, was still in possession of the British.
The citizens of the western country, being anxious to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_631" id="Page_631">[Pg 631]</a></span>
regain possession of it, General Harrison determined to
undertake a winter campaign, having the rëconquest of
that territory in view. Accordingly, General Winchester,
with about eight hundred men, principally from the most
respectable families in Kentucky, was directed to proceed
in advance of the main army. Learning, during his march,
that a party of British were stationed at Frenchtown, situated
on the river Raisin, twenty-six miles from Detroit, he
attacked and dispersed them.</p>

<p>The Americans encamped near the field of battle, a part
of them being protected by close garden pickets. "Although
near an enemy's post, but little precaution was taken to
prevent a surprise. Early in the morning of the 22d of
January, they were attacked by a large force of British
and Indians; the former commanded by Colonel Procter,
the latter by the chiefs Round-head and Split-log. The
troops on the open field were thrown into disorder. General
Winchester and other officers made an ineffectual
attempt to rally them. They fled, but while attempting to
escape, were mostly killed by the Indians. The general
and Colonel Lewis were made prisoners.</p>

<p>"The troops behind the pickets maintained the contest
with undaunted bravery. At length, Colonel Procter
assured General Winchester, that if the remainder of the
Americans would immediately surrender, they should be
protected from massacre; but otherwise, he would set fire
to the village, and would not be responsible for the conduct
of the savages. Intimidated by this threat, General Winchester
sent an order to the troops to surrender.</p>

<p>"Colonel Procter, leaving the wounded without a guard,
marched immediately back to Malden. The Indians accompanied
them a few miles, but returned early the next morning.
Deeds of horror followed: the wounded officers were
dragged from the houses, killed, and scalped in the streets.
The buildings were set on fire. Some who attempted to
escape, were forced back into the flames. Others were put
to death by the tomahawk, and left shockingly mangled in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_632" id="Page_632">[Pg 632]</a></span>
the highway. The infamy of this butchery should not fall
upon the perpetrators alone. It must rest equally upon
those who instigated them to hostility, by whose side they
fought, who were able, and were bound by a solemn engagement
to restrain them."<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> "By this bloody tragedy," observes
Mr. Breckenridge, "all Kentucky was literally in mourning;
for the soldiers thus massacred, tortured, burned, or denied
the common rites of sepulture, were of the most respectable
families of the state; many of them young men of fortune
and property, with numerous friends and relatives. The
remains of these brave youth lay on the ground, beat by
the storms of heaven, and exposed to the beasts of the forest,
until the ensuing autumn, when their friends and relatives
ventured to gather up their bleaching bones, and consigned
them to the tomb."</p>

<p><i>Hornet and Peacock.</i>&mdash;The day following the tragical
affair of Frenchtown, a signal naval battle was fought off
South America, between the Hornet, Captain Lawrence,
and the Peacock, Captain Peake. "In less than fifteen
minutes the Peacock struck her colors, displaying at the
same time a signal of distress. The victors hastened to
the relief of the vanquished; but the Peacock sank before
all her crew could be removed, carrying down nine British
seamen, and three brave and generous Americans. "Of all
our naval victories," remarks a writer, "this is the one which
the Americans recollect with most pleasure." Not that there
was more glory in the achievement, but there was such high-souled
generosity, such unwonted effort, such risk of life to
save the crew of the conquered ship, as rarely, if ever,
before occurred. Her guns were thrown overboard&mdash;her
shot-holes plugged&mdash;every thing done&mdash;but she went down,
and some noble hearts with her. And, then, as if what had
been done were not enough, to crown the whole, the crew
of the Hornet divided their clothes with the prisoners.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_633" id="Page_633">[Pg 633]</a></span>
On his return to the United States, Captain Lawrence was
promoted to the command of the frigate Chesapeake, then
in the harbor of Boston. For several weeks the British
frigate Shannon, of equal force, had been cruising before that
port; and Captain Broke, her commander, had announced
his wish to meet, in single combat, an American frigate.
Inflamed by this challenge, Captain Lawrence, although his
crew was just enlisted, set sail on the 1st of June to seek
the Shannon. Towards evening of the same day they met,
and instantly engaged with unexampled fury. In a very
few minutes, and in quick succession, the sailing-master of
the Chesapeake was killed, Captain Lawrence and three
lieutenants were severely wounded, her rigging was so cut
to pieces that she fell on board the Shannon; Captain Lawrence
received a second and mortal wound, and was carried
below; at this instant, Captain Broke, at the head of his
marines, gallantly boarded the Chesapeake, when resistance
ceased, and the American flag was struck by the British.
Of the crew of the Shannon, twenty-four were killed and
fifty-six wounded. Of that of the Chesapeake, forty-eight
were killed and nearly one hundred wounded. This unexpected
defeat impelled the Americans to seek for circumstances
consoling to their pride, and, in the journals of the
day, many such were stated to have preceded and attended
the action. The youthful and intrepid Lawrence was
lamented with sorrow&mdash;deep, sincere, and lasting. When
carried below, he was asked if the colors should be struck:
"No," he replied; "they shall wave while I live!" Delirious
from excess of suffering, he continued to exclaim, "Don't
give up the ship!"&mdash;an expression consecrated by his countrymen.
He uttered but few other words during the four
days that he survived his defeat."</p>

<p><i>Rëelection of Mr. Madison.</i>&mdash;The period for the election
of president of the United States having again arrived
Mr. Madison was a second time placed at the head of
the nation, and Elbridge Gerry chosen vice-president.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_634" id="Page_634">[Pg 634]</a></span>
They were inaugurated on the 4th day of March, 1813.

<p><i>Capture of York.</i>&mdash;York, the capital of Upper Canada,
was, at this time, the great depository of British military
stores for the western posts, and hence its capture was
deemed an object of great importance, besides that it
would be the means of thwarting the plans of the enemy.
With this object in view, about the middle of April, General
Dearborn issued orders to General Pike to embark on
board a flotilla, with seventeen hundred men, and proceed
to its reduction.</p>

<p>"The force of the enemy, under the command of General
Sheaffe, consisted of seven hundred and fifty regulars,
and five hundred Indians, besides a body of grenadiers and
a corps of Glengary fencibles. These troops had collected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_635" id="Page_635">[Pg 635]</a></span>
near the place of debarkation, which was nearly a mile
and a half from the fort. Major Forsyth was the first who
landed. General Pike soon followed with the remainder of
the troops. After a severe contest of half an hour, the
enemy retreated to their works. The Americans followed;
they had destroyed one battery, and were now within sixty
yards of the main works, when the sudden and tremendous
explosion of a magazine near by filled the air in every direction
with huge stones and fragments of wood, which caused
a dreadful havoc among the troops. One hundred of the
Americans and forty of the British were killed. General
Pike fell mortally wounded. Finding resistance unavailing,
General Sheaffe, with the British regulars, retreated towards
Kingston, leaving the commanding officer of the militia to
make the best terms in his power. The brief outlines of a
capitulation were soon agreed on, and the Americans took
possession of the town. The brave Pike survived but a
few hours; and, like Wolfe at Quebec, drew his last breath
amidst the cheering shouts of victory. His dying head
reposed upon the banner that had lately floated over the
fortress which his valor had aided to conquer.</p>

<p>"General Dearborn now took command of the troops.
The loss of the British was ninety killed, two hundred
wounded, and three hundred prisoners, besides five hundred
militia, released upon parole. A great quantity of stores
was likewise found here, as York was the naval and military
<i>dépôt</i> for Upper Canada. General Sheaffe's baggage and
papers fell into the hands of the Americans.</p>

<p>"On the 8th of May, General Dearborn evacuated the
capital of Upper Canada: and having crossed the lake, for
the purpose of leaving the wounded at Sackett's Harbor,
again set sail, and disembarked his troops at Niagara."<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p><i>Siege of Fort Meigs.</i>&mdash;General Harrison was marching
to the support of General Winchester, when the tidings of
the defeat and massacre at Frenchtown reached him. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_636" id="Page_636">[Pg 636]</a></span>
he could now be of no service to that general, he took post
at a place called the Rapids, on the south side of the Maumee,
a river flowing into the west end of Lake Erie, where
he erected a fort, which he named Fort Meigs, in honor of
the governor of Ohio.</p>

<p>The erection of this fortification was by no means agreeable
to the British, and a plan was early laid to capture and
destroy it. On the 26th of April, a large party of British
and Indians, combined, made their appearance on the opposite
side of the river; and, on the morning of the 26th, the
Indians were conveyed over in boats, and surrounded the
fort in every direction.</p>

<p>On the 29th, the siege began, all intercourse with other
posts being cut off. During the preceding night, the British
had thrown up a mound, on which to plant their guns, and
behind which they could secure themselves from the fire
of the Americans.</p>

<p>Next day, several of the Americans were wounded; and
General Harrison himself, being continually exposed, had
several narrow escapes. On the following day, the enemy
fired two hundred and fifty-six times from their batteries.
The Americans fired less rapidly, but with greater effect.
A bullet struck the seat on which General Harrison was
sitting, and at the same time a volunteer was wounded, as
he stood directly opposite to him.</p>

<p>In this manner, several days passed; during which, General
Harrison and his soldiers displayed the utmost coolness
and determination. They were resolved to surrender only
when they could fight no longer&mdash;when ammunition failed,
or food and water could no longer be obtained.</p>

<p>At this critical juncture, intelligence was received that
General Clay, with twelve hundred men, was hastening to
their relief. He was already but a few miles up the river,
and an officer was immediately dispatched, directing him
to land one-half of his force on the opposite side, for the purpose
of forcing the enemy's batteries and spiking his cannon.</p>

<p>The gallant Colonel Dudley was deputed to execute this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_637" id="Page_637">[Pg 637]</a></span>
order; but, unfortunately, his troops pursued the retreating
enemy until, suddenly, a party of Indians, under command
of the celebrated Tecumseh, rose from ambush upon them.
The slaughter was terrible. The brave Colonel Dudley
was among the killed, and more than five hundred of his
detachment were taken prisoners. The other part of General
Clay's troops were more fortunate. And yet, lured by
a party of Indians, whom they wished to destroy, they proceeded
into the woods, where they would have been cut off,
had not General Harrison dispatched a company of cavalry
to cover their retreat.</p>

<p>At length, the British gave up the contest. Although
they had made many prisoners, this did not aid them, in
relation to the fort. The 8th of May brought an end to
the toils of the Americans in the fort of Camp Meigs. An
exchange of prisoners took place, and on the morning of
the 9th, the enemy commenced their retreat. Thus did
Harrison sustain, in effect, a siege of twelve days; during
which, the enemy had fired eighteen hundred shells and
cannon-balls, besides keeping up an almost continual discharge
of small arms. The loss of each was about equal.</p>

<p><i>Perry's Victory.</i>&mdash;During the summer, by the exertions
of Commodore Perry, an American squadron had been fitted
out on Lake Erie. It consisted of nine small vessels, carrying
fifty-four guns. A British squadron had also been
built and equipped, under the superintendence of Commodore
Barclay. It consisted of six vessels, mounting sixty-three
guns. Commodore Perry, immediately sailing, offered
battle to his adversary; and on the 10th of September the
British commander left the harbor of Malden, to accept the
offer. In a few hours, the wind shifted, giving the Americans
the advantage. Perry, forming the line of battle,
hoisted his flag, on which was inscribed the words of the
dying Lawrence, "Don't give up the ship!" Loud huzzas
from all the vessels proclaimed the animation which this
motto inspired. About noon, the firing commenced; after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_638" id="Page_638">[Pg 638]</a></span>
a short action, two of the British vessels surrendered; and
the rest of the American squadron now joining in the battle,
the victory was rendered decisive and complete. The
British loss was forty-one killed and ninety-four wounded.
The American loss was twenty-seven killed and ninety-six
wounded; of which number, twenty-one were killed and
sixty wounded on board the flag-ship Lawrence, whose
whole complement of able-bodied men, before the action,
was about one hundred. The commodore gave intelligence
of the victory to General Harrison in these words: "We
have met the enemy, and they are ours. Two ships, two
brigs, one schooner, and one sloop."</p>

<p><i>Battle of the Thames.</i>&mdash;By means of the victory of Commodore
Perry, the Americans became masters of Lake Erie,
but the territory of Michigan, which had been surrendered
by Hull, was still in possession of Colonel Procter. The
next movements of General Harrison were therefore against
the British and Indians at Detroit and Malden. General
Harrison had previously assembled a portion of the Ohio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_639" id="Page_639">[Pg 639]</a></span>
militia on the Sandusky river; and on the 7th of September
four thousand from Kentucky, the flower of the state, with
Governor Shelby at their head, arrived at his camp. With
the cöoperation of the fleet, it was determined to proceed
at once to Malden. On the 27th, the troops were received
on board, and reached Malden on the same day; but the
British had, in the mean time, destroyed the fort and public
stores, and had retreated along the Thames towards the
Moravian villages, together with Tecumseh's Indians, consisting
of twelve or fifteen hundred. It was now resolved
to proceed in pursuit of Procter. On the 5th of October,
a severe action occurred between the two armies at the
river Thames, by which the British army fell into the hands
of the Americans. In this battle, Tecumseh was killed, and
the Indians fled. The British loss was nineteen regulars
killed, fifty wounded, and about six hundred prisoners. The
American loss, in killed and wounded, amounted to upwards
of fifty. Procter made his escape down the Thames.</p>

of Detroit, which, on the approach of Harrison's army, had

<p><i>Creek War.</i>&mdash;While affairs were proceeding at the North,
the public attention was arrested by hostilities commenced
by the Creek Indians. They had been visited by Tecumseh,
who had persuaded them that the Great Spirit required
them to unite in an attempt to extirpate the whites. In
the fall of 1812, a sanguinary war had been waged by the
Creeks and Seminoles, against the frontier inhabitants of
Georgia. At the head of two thousand five hundred volunteers
from Tennessee, General Jackson had marched into
their country, and compelled them to desist; but, soon after
his return, their animosity burst forth with increased and
fatal violence. Dreading their cruelty, some three hundred
men, women, and children, took refuge in Fort Mimms.
Here, at noon-day, on the 30th of August, they were surprised
by a party of six hundred Indians, who, from the
fort, drove the people into the houses which it inclosed.
To these they set fire. Seventeen only of the refugees
escaped to carry the horrid tidings to the neighboring
stations. But the whites resolved on vengeance. General
Jackson, at the head of three thousand five hundred militia
of Tennessee, again took up his march into the southern
wilderness. A detachment, under General Coffee, encountering
at Tallushatchie a body of Indians, a sanguinary
conflict ensued. The latter fought with desperation, neither
giving nor receiving quarter, until nearly every warrior had
perished. Yet still, the spirit of the Creeks remained unsubdued.
With no little sagacity and skill, they selected and
fortified another position on the Tallapoosa, called by themselves
Tohopeka, and by whites Horse-shoe Bend. Here
nearly a thousand warriors, animated with a fierce and
determined resolution, were collected. Three thousand
men, commanded by General Jackson, marched to attack
this post. To prevent escape, a detachment under General
Coffee encircled the Bend. The main body advanced to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_641" id="Page_641">[Pg 641]</a></span>
the fortress, and for a few minutes the opposing forces were
engaged muzzle to muzzle at the port-holes; but at length,
the troops leaping over the walls, mingled in furious combat
with the savages. When the Indians, fleeing to the
river, beheld the troops on the opposite bank, they returned,
and fought with increased fury and desperation. Six hundred
warriors were killed; four only yielded themselves
prisoners; the remaining three hundred escaped. Of the
whites, fifty-five were killed and one hundred and forty-six
wounded. It was deemed probable that further resistance
would be made by the Indians at a place called the Hickory-ground;
but, on General Jackson's arriving thither in April,
1814, the principal chiefs came out to meet him, and among
them was Weatherford, a half-blood, distinguished equally for
his talents and cruelty. "I am in your power," said he; "do
with me what you please. I have done the white people all
the harm I could. I have fought them, and fought them
bravely. There was a time when I had a choice; I have
none now; even hope is ended. Once, I could animate my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_642" id="Page_642">[Pg 642]</a></span>
warriors; but I cannot animate the dead. They can no
longer hear my voice; their bones are at Tallushatchie,
Talladega, Emuckfaw, and Tohopeka. While there was a
chance of success, I never supplicated peace; but my people
are gone, and I now ask it for my nation and myself."
Peace was concluded, and General Jackson and his troops
enjoyed an honorable but short repose.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p><i>Battles of Chippewa and Bridgewater.</i>&mdash;In the beginning
of July, General Brown crossed the Niagara with about
three thousand men, and took possession without opposition
of Fort Erie. In a strong position at Chippewa, a few
miles distant, was intrenched an equal number of British
troops, commanded by General Riall. On the 4th, General
Brown approached their works; and the next day, on the
plains of Chippewa, an obstinate and sanguinary battle was
fought, which compelled the British to retire to their intrenchments.
In this action, which was fought with great judgment
and coolness on both sides, the loss of the Americans
was about four hundred men; that of the British was
upwards of five hundred. Soon afterwards, General Riall,
abandoning his works, retired to the heights of Burlington.
Here Lieutenant-general Drummond, with a large rëinforcement,
joined him, and, assuming the command, led back the
army towards the American camp. On the 25th was fought
the battle of Bridgewater, which began at four in the afternoon,
and continued till midnight. After a desperate conflict,
the British troops were withdrawn, and the Americans left
in possession of the field. The loss on both sides was severe,
and nearly equal. Generals Brown and Scott having both
been severely wounded, the command devolved upon General
Ripley. He remained a few hours upon the hill, collected
the wounded, and then retired unmolested to the
camp. This battle was fought near the cataract of Niagara,
whose roar was silenced by the thunder of cannon and the
din of arms, but was distinctly heard during the pauses of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_643" id="Page_643">[Pg 643]</a></span>
the fight. The American general found his force so much
weakened, that he deemed it prudent again to occupy Fort
Erie. On the 4th of August, it was invested by General
Drummond with five thousand troops. In the night, between
the 14th and 15th, the besiegers made a daring assault upon
the fort, which was repelled with conspicuous gallantry by
the garrison, the former being more than nine hundred men,
the latter but eighty-four. The siege was still continued.
On the 2d of September, General Brown having recovered
from his wounds, threw himself into the fort, and took command
of the garrison. For their fate, great anxiety was
felt by the nation, which was, however, in some degree
removed, by the march from Plattsburgh of five thousand
men to their relief. After an hour of close fighting, they
entered the fort, having killed, wounded, and taken one
thousand of the British. The loss of the Americans was
also considerable, amounting to more than five hundred.
On the 21st of September, the forty-ninth day of the siege,
General Drummond withdrew his forces.</p>

<p><i>Capture of Washington.</i>&mdash;About the middle of August,
a British squadron of between fifty and sixty sail, arrived
in the Chesapeake, with troops destined for the attack of
Washington, the capital of the United States. A body of
five thousand of them having landed, an action was fought
at Bladensburgh, six miles from Washington. General
Winder commanded the American force; Commodore
Barney the flotilla. The British were commanded by
Major-general Ross and Rear-admiral Cockburn. The
Americans were repulsed, and General Ross, at the head
of about seven hundred men, took possession of Washington,
and burned the capitol, the president's house, and public
offices, the arsenal, the navy yard, and the bridge over the
Potomac. The loss of the British in this expedition, was
nearly a thousand men in killed, wounded, and missing;
the loss of the Americans was ten or twelve killed, and
thirty or forty wounded. Commodore Barney's horse was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_644" id="Page_644">[Pg 644]</a></span>
killed under him, and himself wounded in the thigh, and
taken prisoner; but he was paroled on the field of battle
for his bravery.</p>

<p>After the capture of Washington, the British army
rëembarked on board the fleet in the Patuxent, and Admiral
Cockburn moved down that river, and proceeded up
the Chesapeake. On the 29th of August, the corporation
of Alexandria submitted to articles of capitulation, and the
city was delivered up to the British. On the 11th of September,
the British admiral appeared at the mouth of the
Patapsco, fourteen miles from Baltimore, with a fleet of
ships of war and transports, amounting to fifty sail. The
next day, six thousand troops were landed at North point,
and commenced their march towards the city. In this
march, when the foremost ranks were harassed by a brisk
fire from a wood, Major-general Ross was mortally
wounded. A battle was fought on this day. The American
forces, the militia, and the inhabitants of Baltimore,
made a gallant defence, but were compelled to retreat; the
British, however, abandoning the attempt to get possession
of the city, retired to their shipping during the night of the
13th of September.</p>

<p><i>Engagement on Lake Champlain.</i>&mdash;Towards the close
of the winter of 1814, the troops under General Wilkinson
removed from their winter-quarters at French Mills, and
took station opposite Plattsburgh. At this time, General
Izard assumed the command. During the summer, the
troops were reduced, by various detachments, to fifteen hundred.
Moreover, the defences here were mostly in a state of
dilapidation, and the stores and ordinances in great disorder.</p>

<p>It was while troops and fortifications were in this state,
that intelligence was received that Sir George Prevost,
governor-general of Canada, was on his march, at the head
of fourteen hundred men, well-disciplined, with ample
stores and a numerous train of artillery. In addition, the
British had a respectable naval force on the lake, amounting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_645" id="Page_645">[Pg 645]</a></span>
to ninety-five guns and one thousand and fifty men.
To cope with this combined, and vastly superior force, the
Americans had the troops already named, and a flotilla
carrying eighty-six guns and eight hundred and twenty-six
men.</p>

<p>On the 3d of September, Sir George Prevost, having
taken possession of Champlain, proceeded to occupy Plattsburgh.
But, instead of making the most of his advantage,
the British general contented himself with erecting works,
by which to annoy the Americans&mdash;thus giving the latter
opportunity to strengthen themselves, and to summon from
New York and Vermont a considerable force to their aid.
At the moment, the delay of the British was not understood,
but in a few days it was explained by the appearance of
the British squadron, which was observed bearing down in
order of battle. It consisted of the frigate Confiance, carrying
thirty-nine guns; twenty-seven of which were twenty-four
pounders; the brig Linnet, of sixteen guns; the sloops
Chub and Finch, each carrying eleven guns; thirteen gallies,
five of two guns, and the remainder of one gun. Commodore
McDonough, commanding the American squadron,
lay at this time at anchor in Plattsburgh bay. His fleet
consisted of the Saratoga, of twenty-six guns, eight of
which were long twenty-four pounders; the Eagle, twenty
guns; the Ticonderoga, seventeen guns; the Preble, seven,
and twenty gallies, six of which carried two, and the
remainder one gun each. One of this squadron had been
constructed in eighteen days, from timber cut for this purpose,
standing on the shore of the lake.</p>

<p>At about nine o'clock, the British commander, Captain
Downie, anchored in line abreast the American squadron,
about three hundred yards distant&mdash;the Confiance taking a
position opposite the Saratoga&mdash;the Linnet, opposite the
Eagle&mdash;the British galleys and one of the sloops, opposite
the Ticonderoga, Preble, and left division of the American
galleys&mdash;the other sloop was opposed to the right division.</p>

<p>The action now opened, and at the same time an engagement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_646" id="Page_646">[Pg 646]</a></span>
commenced on the land, between the forces under
General McComb and Sir George Prevost. The fate of
the day depended chiefly on the result of the engagement
between the two large vessels. For two hours, this contest
was waged, with great skill and bravery, between these
two; but the greater weight of the enemy's battery seemed
to incline the scale of victory. By this time, the guns of
the Saratoga, on the starboard side, had been either dismounted
or rendered unmanageable: nor was the condition
of the Confiance much better. The fortune of the day
now depended upon a difficult man&#339;uvre&mdash;to change the
position of the vessels, so as to bring their larboard sides
into action. In this, the Saratoga succeeded, while the
attempt on the part of the Confiance failed. The explosions
of the former, on wheeling, now became tremendous,
and a short and successful work was made of it. In
eighteen minutes, the Saratoga announced her surrender.
Meanwhile, the Linnet had struck to the Eagle. Three of
the galleys were sunk; the rest escaped. With the exception
of the latter, the entire squadron was captured. It
was a most sanguinary and disastrous contest. The Saratoga
had received in her hull fifty-five round shot; the
Confiance, one hundred and five. Twice the Saratoga was
set on fire by hot shot. The time occupied in the action
was two hours and twenty minutes. Captain Downie, of
the Confiance, was killed, with forty-nine of his men, and
sixty wounded. The Saratoga lost twenty-eight killed and
twenty-nine wounded. The total loss of the American
squadron amounted to fifty-two killed and fifty-eight
wounded. The loss of the British was eighty-four killed,
one hundred and ten wounded, and eight hundred and
fifty-six prisoners.</p>

<p>This engagement took place in sight of the two armies.
But they were not idle spectators of the exciting scene.
They also became engaged, and, during the naval conflict,
the noise of cannon, bombs, rockets responded to the explosions
on the water. Three desperate efforts were made by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_647" id="Page_647">[Pg 647]</a></span>
the British to cross over, and storm the American works.
Other modes of attack were resorted to, but repulse and
defeat followed each and every one of them. On the loss
of the squadron, which was as painful as unexpected, the
efforts of the British relaxed; but the firing was still kept
up, and continued till night, when the siege was raised, and
the artillery withdrawn. During the night, Prevost withdrew
his forces and retired.</p>

<p>Thus failed a project for which liberal preparations had
been made, and of whose success, the highest hopes had
been indulged. Thus Sir George Prevost was taught, that
not then, nor there, whatever he might do at some future
day, could he display British colors as a token of triumph.
The "star-spangled banner" must still wave on the waters
of Champlain; and our national flag still float over the fortifications
of Plattsburgh.</p>

<p><i>Battle of New Orleans.</i>&mdash;In the spring of 1814, General
Jackson was appointed a major-general in the army of the
United States, and assigned to the protection of the city of
New Orleans, and the circumjacent territory. To this
duty he addressed himself with a promptitude and resolution
characteristic of the man, and commensurate with the
preparations which, it was supposed, the British had made
to subdue it.</p>

<p>On the 1st day of December, the general reached New
Orleans, and, on the 4th, rumor was rife that a hostile fleet
was already wending its way along the coast. On the 6th,
this rumor was confirmed. Admiral Cochrane and Sir
George Cockburn, after the burning of Washington, and
subsequent retreat down the Chesapeake, were now directing
their course towards New Orleans. The expedition
was formidable, consisting of more than eighty sail, which
were still to be rëinforced; on board the transports were
some eleven thousand troops, "veteran heroes of the Peninsula,"
ardent for the attack&mdash;commanded by four generals
of great experience&mdash;two admirals, and twelve thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_648" id="Page_648">[Pg 648]</a></span>
seamen and marines, with fire-ships, rockets, ammunition,
and artillery in abundance.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of New Orleans were, at this time, supposed
to be not less than thirty thousand&mdash;a number quite
sufficient, under ordinary circumstances, to furnish adequate
assistance. But they were chiefly of French and Spanish
extraction. By the purchase of Louisiana, they had recently
become citizens of the United States; but the sympathies
and patriotism of some had not followed their transfer. In
addition, the city had few, if any defences; arms, ammunition,
troops&mdash;all were wanting.</p>

<p>In circumstances like these, General Jackson assumed
command of the city. He saw the danger which impended;
he saw the importance of power amid the conflicting elements.
He has sometimes been censured for his despotic
bearing during these scenes of turmoil and confusion. But
we must not judge too severely. He felt the emergency,
and did not hesitate to proclaim martial law, as, in his view,
the only means of safety and protection to the city.</p>

<p>The force which General Jackson had brought with him
from Mobile, amounted to only about fifteen hundred men,
and consisted of Coffee's Tennessee volunteers, Hind's company
of cavalry, and the seventh and forty-fourth regiments.
To these were added three hundred city volunteers, and a
battalion of men of color, two hundred, making a total,
with the troops in garrison at Fort St. Philips, of only
twenty-five hundred men. This force was so obviously
inadequate, that General Jackson made every effort to
supply the deficiency; and in this, he was seconded by the
executive of Kentucky, Tennessee, and Louisiana. But
their patriotic exertions were, in a great measure, unavailing;
there being, at no time, of Louisianians, in the army
of General Jackson, more than nine hundred, and still less
from any other state. The naval force, stationed at New
Orleans, consisted of six gun-boats and several smaller vessels,
under command of Commodore Daniel T. Patterson.</p>

<p>Soon after reaching New Orleans, General Jackson proceeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_649" id="Page_649">[Pg 649]</a></span>
to examine the various fortified points below the
city, and gave directions for strengthening them as his
means allowed. On the 9th, he returned to the city,
whence he proceeded on a similar tour of inspection to the
lakes. Contrary to all expectation, the British armament,
instead of coming up the Mississippi, entered the lakes
which connect with the gulf, and, on the 23d of December,
commenced landing their forces on the narrow strip of
land bordering the river. Before reaching this point, however,
an engagement had taken place between the gun-boats
and a large British force, which had resulted in the
capture of the former. It was a spirited action of some
two hours, and the Americans surrendered only when the
enemy had gained their decks, and overpowered them by
numbers. The whole number of guns in the American
vessels was twenty-three, and of men one hundred and
eighty-three. The British had forty-five boats, forty-three
pieces of cannon, and twelve hundred men. The loss of
the Americans was very small, while that of the British was
not less than three hundred, including several officers,
killed and wounded.</p>

<p>The invading army, it was now certain, was at hand.
Indeed, they had effected a landing; they were on the
banks of the Mississippi, only nine miles from the city.
This, as we have stated, was on the 23d of December.</p>

<p>General Jackson had decided, in case of their landing, to
attack them the first possible moment. "Feeble as my
force is," said he, "I am resolved to assail the enemy on his
first landing, and perish sooner than he shall reach the city:"
a resolution which he now proceeded to fulfill with all the
energy in his power. That same night was the time
appointed.</p>

<p>A little before dark, the American troops arrived in view
of the enemy. They were, at this time, about two thousand
strong, but afterwards rëinforced to the number of one
thousand more. Among the vessels, which had escaped
the British, was one of considerable size, called the Caroline.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_650" id="Page_650">[Pg 650]</a></span>
With this, Commodore Patterson was to drop down
the river, anchor in front of the British, and commence the
attack, which should be a signal for a general assault.</p>

<p>A British officer, who was present during the scene, thus
describes the dismay of the British troops, when first the
Caroline opened her appalling fire upon them.</p>

<p>"The day passed without any alarm, and, the darkness
having set in, the fires were made to blaze with increased
splendor; our evening meal was eaten, and we prepared to
sleep. But about half-past seven o'clock, the attention of
several individuals was drawn to a large vessel, which
seemed to be stealing up the river till she came opposite to
our camp, when her anchor was dropped, and the sails leisurely
furled. We hailed her, but she gave no answer.
This forboded no good. Soon after, we heard some one
cry, in a commanding voice, 'Give them this for the honor
of America!' and they did give it to us. Explosion after
explosion burst upon us, and showers of grape swept down
numbers in the camp.</p>

<p>"Nor to this dreadful storm of fire had we any thing to
oppose. Our artillery was too light to bring into competition
with an adversary so powerful. Our only alternative
was to shelter the men, as much as possible, from this iron
hail; and our only shelter was to hasten under the dyke
["levee"]. There we lay for an hour, unable to move from
our ground, or offer any opposition; when the sound of
musketry, at some distance, called our attention towards
the pickets, and warned us to prepare for a closer and more
desperate strife. Soon after, our apprehensions were realized.
A semi-circular blaze of musketry burst upon us.
We were surrounded." The assailants were Coffee's brigade
of six hundred dismounted riflemen.</p>

<p>The further details of proceedings that night, we must
omit. For two hours, such warfare was carried on as the
darkness allowed. The American troops did not exceed
two thousand; the force of the enemy reached, at length,
four or five thousand. The Americans were not the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_651" id="Page_651">[Pg 651]</a></span>
victors, nor were they vanquished. They retired in safety,
with a loss of but twenty-four killed, one hundred and fifteen
wounded, and seventy-four made prisoners. The loss
of the British was not less than four hundred in killed,
wounded, and prisoners. Among the Americans killed
were two valiant officers&mdash;Colonel Lauderdale and Lieutenant
McClelland. This action was probably the salvation
of New Orleans. From that hour, the Americans had
more confidence; the British less.</p>

<p>On the 4th of January, the long-expected rëinforcement
from Kentucky, amounting to two thousand two hundred
and fifty, under command of Major-general Thomas, reached
New Orleans, but the great advantage, anticipated from
this additional force, failed of being realized. Not more
than five hundred of them were supplied with muskets
fit for service; for the remainder, none could possibly be
furnished.</p>

<p>For several days longer, the armies continued in view of
each other, but comparatively inactive. Preparations, however,
were making. The clouds were gathering. The
storm was approaching. At length, the 8th of January
arrived; a day rendered memorable by the victory achieved
by the Americans over a British force greatly superior, and
in every possible way prepared for the contest.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 8th, signals, intended to produce
concert in the enemy's movements, were descried. Sky-rockets
shot up. Preparations, as if for immediate action,
were observed. And thus it proved. The important day
had arrived, and operations were commenced on the part
of the British, by showers of bombs and balls upon the
American line: while congreve-rockets, in multitudes, went
whizzing through the air. The two divisions, under command
of Sir Edward Packenham in person, and supported
by Generals Keane and Gibbs, now moved forward. A
dense fog enabled them to approach within a short distance
of the American intrenchments without being discovered.
Their march was dignified&mdash;their step, firm&mdash;their bearing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_652" id="Page_652">[Pg 652]</a></span>
lofty. Meanwhile, all was silence among the Americans
behind the parapets. The guns were loaded&mdash;the matches
were ready&mdash;all were waiting, with breathless anxiety, for
the word of command. Jackson stood an intent observer of
the scene. He watched every movement&mdash;weighed every
circumstance&mdash;measured the lessening distance. They
had reached the critical spot to which the guns were
pointed&mdash;the voice of Jackson was heard, as in tones of
thunder, "Fire!" and, in an instant, such a storm of death
rolled over the astonished British, as was scarcely ever
before witnessed. The front ranks were mowed down, and
their advance arrested. At this critical juncture, Sir
Edward Packenham threw himself in front of the astonished
columns, and urged them on. But at that instant, he
fell mortally wounded, and, nearly at the same time, Generals
Gibbs and Keane were borne from the field, dangerously
wounded. The troops now fled. In their flight,
they were met by General Lambert, on the advance with
a reserve force, and urged once more to renew the attack;
but his commands were unheeded.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

   <img src="images/illus-655.jpg" alt="BATTLE OF NEW ORLEANS." title="BATTLE OF NEW ORLEANS."/>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_653" id="Page_653">[Pg 653]</a></span></p>

<p>There were, indeed, other attempts made upon the
American works in other quarters, and they were partially
successful; but, in the sequel, the British were every where
repulsed&mdash;the American flag waved in triumph&mdash;the city
of New Orleans was safe&mdash;and, that night, joy and gladness
were in every family.</p>

<p>The American effective force, at the time, on the left
bank, was three thousand seven hundred; that of the enemy,
at least nine thousand, and, by some authorities, they were
reckoned still more numerous. The killed, wounded, and
prisoners, as ascertained on the day after the battle, by
Colonel Hayne, the inspector-general, was two thousand
six hundred. General Lambert's report to Lord Bathurst,
stated it to be two thousand and seventy. Among the killed
was the commander-in-chief, and Major-general Gibbs, who
died of his wounds the following day; besides many other
valuable officers. The loss of the Americans, in killed and
wounded, was but thirteen.</p>

<p>It is certainly surprising that generals so distinguished for
their sagacity, and so experienced in military tactics, as were
the British, should have hazarded such an assault. It seems
probable that the enterprise was one of great magnitude
and danger, in their view; but warranted by the circumstances
in which they were placed. But, on the other
hand, the Americans were entitled to all possible praise.
Their bravery and zeal were conspicuous through the
entire contest. It was fortunate that their commander was
possessed of great courage and equal skill. General Jackson
acquired greater reputation, on this occasion, than he
had gained at any previous period of his life, distinguished
as his military fame had become.</p>

<p>To the benevolent heart, there will ever be connected
with this battle one sad, sad reflection. The carnage of
that day&mdash;the groans, sorrows, sufferings caused by that
conflict&mdash;might have been spared. Peace between the two
nations had actually been agreed upon. Oh! could some
breeze have wafted the intelligence to these Western shores<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_654" id="Page_654">[Pg 654]</a></span>
ere the dawn of that 8th of January, 1815, what streams of
blood had been stayed! how many precious lives would
have been spared! what despair and destitution averted
from families and individuals!</p>

<p><i>Treaty of Ghent.</i>&mdash;The brilliant successes of the Americans
were duly appreciated, and joy and exultation pervaded
the nation. Tidings of peace soon followed. A
negotiation, which had been opened at Ghent in the Netherlands,
towards the close of 1814, between the American
commissioners, J. Q. Adams, Bayard, Clay, Russel, and
Gallatin, and the British commissioners, Gambier, Goulburn,
and Adams, resulted in a treaty of peace, which was
signed on the 24th of December. It immediately received
the approbation of the prince regent, and was ratified by
the president and senate on the 18th day of February.
This was a welcome event to all parties. Among a portion
of the people, the war had never been popular. A
large debt had been contracted, and the commerce of the
country had greatly suffered. There was a general joy
that the war had terminated; yet some were disposed to
inquire, what object had been gained? It was true, the
credit of the country in respect to military skill, but especially
as to naval tact, had been greatly increased. An
arrogant, invading foe had been driven from our shore.
Our national honor vindicated&mdash;but, in the end, the treaty
negotiated and ratified was silent as to the subjects for
which the war was professedly declared. It provided only
for the suspension of hostilities&mdash;the exchange of prisoners&mdash;the
restoration of territories and possessions obtained by
the contending powers during the war&mdash;the adjustment
of unsettled boundaries&mdash;and for a combined effort to effect
the entire abolition of traffic in slaves. But, notwithstanding
several important omissions, the treaty was joyfully
received, and the various classes of society once more
began to turn their attention to their accustomed trades
and occupations.</p>

<p><i>Close of Mr. Madison's Administration.</i>&mdash;The remainder
of Mr. Madison's administration was marked by few
events or measures of national importance. Yet, we may
briefly notice the conclusion of a treaty, conducted at
Algiers, with the dey of Algiers, by William Shaler and
Commodore Stephen Decatur, on the 30th of June, 1815&mdash;a
"convention by which to regulate the commerce between
the territories of the United States and of his Britannic
Majesty," concluded at London, July 3&mdash;and the incorporation
of a national bank, with a capital of thirty-five millions
of dollars.</p>

<p>February 12th, the electoral votes for Mr. Madison's
successor were counted in the presence of both houses of
congress, when it appeared that Mr. Monroe was elected
by a large majority. The following is a summary of the
votes:</p>

<p>The elevation of Mr. Monroe to the presidency was an
event highly auspicious to the interests of the nation. Besides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_657" id="Page_657">[Pg 657]</a></span>
having been employed for many years in high and
responsible stations under the government, he possessed a
sound and discriminating judgment, and a remarkably calm
and quiet temperament. In not a few of the qualities of
his mind, he resembled Washington, and, like that great
and good man, apparently had the true interests of his
country in view in the acts and measures of his administration.
He may be said to be fortunate in respect to the
time and circumstances of his accession to the presidency.
A war, of whose justice and expediency a respectable portion
of the country had strong doubts&mdash;and as to which,
therefore, loud and even angry debate had existed, both in
congress and throughout the country&mdash;that war had terminated,
and the asperities growing out of different views
entertained of it, were fast subsiding. Commerce, too, was
beginning to revive, and the manufacturers were hoping for
more auspicious days. In every department of industry,
there was the commencement of activity; and, although the
country had suffered too long and too seriously to regain
at once her former prosperity, hopes of better times were
indulged, and great confidence was reposed in the wise and
prudent counsels of the new president.</p>

<p>A review of the principal measures and events during
the presidency of Mr. Monroe, will require us to notice the

<p><i>Tour of the President.</i>&mdash;This took place in the summer
and autumn following Mr. Monroe's inauguration, and
extended through the Northern and Eastern states of the
Union. It was an auspicious measure, and contributed, no
doubt, in a degree, to his popularity. He had in view, the
better discharge of his duty as president, in superintending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_658" id="Page_658">[Pg 658]</a></span>
the works of public defence, and most probably the cultivation
of friendly feelings with the great mass of the people.
These objects were happily accomplished. The works of
public defence, which he wished personally to inspect or to
provide for, were the fortifications of the sea-coast and inland
frontiers, naval docks, and the navy itself. For all these
objects, congress had made liberal appropriations, and by
personal observation, he sought the means of guiding his
judgment as to the best mode of promoting the interests
thus committed to his care.</p>

<p>The president made two other visits of a similar kind,
during his first term, viz: one in the summer of the following
year, and the other in the summer of 1819. The former
was to the Chesapeake bay and the country lying on its
shores. The other was to the Southern and South-western
states of the Union. In the course of a few weeks he
visited Charleston, Savannah, and Augusta, as also the
Cherokee nation, Nashville, Louisville, and other places.
The same national objects commanded his attention as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_659" id="Page_659">[Pg 659]</a></span>
during his other tours, and the same spirit of courtesy and
deference was manifested towards him.</p>

<p><i>Admission of Missouri.</i>&mdash;In another place, (p. <a href="#Page_538">538</a>,) we
have had occasion to notice the periods at which the
several states, formed since the adoption of the Federal
Constitution, have been admitted into the Union, and Missouri
among them; but, as in respect to this state, there
were new and peculiar considerations involved, it is deemed
important to speak of them in this place more at large.&mdash;The
proposition to admit Missouri into the Union, was considered
at the same time with Maine; but, although congress
passed the act of admission for both at once, it was <i>conditional</i>
in regard to Missouri. A clause in the constitution
of this state, requiring the legislature to enact a law "to
prevent free negroes and mulattoes from coming to and
settling in the state," was obnoxious to a majority of the
members of congress. After a long debate in that body, it
was decided that Missouri should be admitted, on the condition
that no laws should be passed, by which any free
citizens of the United States should be prevented from
enjoying the rights to which they were entitled by the
constitution of the United States.</p>

<p>There had previously been a long and exciting debate in
congress, on the subject of the restriction of slavery in the
bill admitting Missouri. The bill for admitting that territory,
contained a provision prohibiting slavery within the
new state; but, having passed the house of representatives,
it was arrested in the senate. Strong sectional parties, in
reference to this subject, appeared, not only in congress,
but throughout the country. It was deemed imminently a
time of danger to the general interests of the nation and the
Union itself. The dissolution of the general government
seemed to be threatened. That the pernicious system of
involuntary servitude should be further extended, seemed
to be abhorrent to the minds of most of the wise and good.
On the other hand, the rights of the slave-holding states were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_660" id="Page_660">[Pg 660]</a></span>
thought by themselves, at least, to be invaded. Accordingly,
members of congress from the non-slave-holding states, strenuously
advocated the restriction; while members from the
slave-holding portion of the country as strenuously opposed it.</p>

<p>The long and earnest debates on the subject, were concluded,
only by the parties accepting a <i>compromise</i>, in
consequence of which, slavery was to be tolerated in Missouri,
but forbidden in all that part of Louisiana as ceded
by France, lying north of thirty-six degrees thirty minutes
north latitude, except so much as was embraced
within the limits of the state. The vote in the house of
representatives was several times given for excluding
slavery; but the senate disagreed, and would not yield to
the house. When the house yielded, at length, to the
opinion of the senate, it was by a majority of <i>four</i> only, in
favor of the bill, omitting the clause of exclusion, and containing
that of the interdiction of slavery elsewhere, as
already defined. The compromise happily averted whatever
danger there might have been to the union of the states.</p>

<p>When Missouri, by a solemn act of her legislature, had
accepted the fundamental condition imposed by congress,
that she would not authorize the passage of any laws excluding
citizens of other states from enjoying the privileges to
which they were entitled by the constitution of the United
States, she was declared a member of the Union. This
occurred August 10th, 1821.</p>

<p><i>Provision for indigent Officers and Soldiers.</i>&mdash;In 1818,
a law was passed by congress, granting pensions to the
surviving officers and soldiers of the Revolutionary war,
which included all who had served nine months in the continental
army at any period of the war, provided it was at
one term of enlistment. Another act of congress, following
at the expiration of two years, modified, and in some degree
restricted this law, by confining the pension to those who
were in destitute circumstances. Still, under this condition,
the number who received the bounty, or rather the justice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_661" id="Page_661">[Pg 661]</a></span>
of their country, was very large, not less than thirteen
thousand having experienced the grateful relief. Through
the inability of the government, soon after the war, these
soldiers who had so largely contributed to the liberties of
their country, had never been duly compensated. They
now received a welcome, though late remuneration.</p>

<p><i>Rëelection of Mr. Monroe.</i>&mdash;In March, 1821, Mr. Monroe
entered upon his second term of office, having been
rëelected president by nearly an unanimous vote. Mr.
Tompkins was also continued in the vice-presidency. The
following table exhibits the vote of the several electoral
colleges:</p>

<p>No president, since Washington, has received so decided
an expression of the public will. His popularity seemed
to be the result of his moderation in politics, his candid
temper, and his wise and useful measures. His administration
throughout was the era of good feeling.</p>

<p><i>Seminole War.</i>&mdash;Within the southern limits of the United
States, but mostly in Florida, lived a tribe, or confederacy
of Indians, named <i>Seminoles</i>. They consisted,
originally, of fugitives from the northern tribes, resident
within the limits of the United States. To these fugitives,
additions were made from the Creek Indians, numbers of
whom were dissatisfied with the provisions of the treaty of
1814, and negroes, who had absconded from their masters.
The resentments enkindled in the breasts of these miserable
people, are believed to have been fanned by foreign
emissaries, of whom the most noted were two Englishmen,
Alexander Arbuthnot and Robert C. Ambrister. The consequence
was, that outrages were committed upon the
inhabitants of the states on our southern borders, the
progress of which it became necessary to arrest.</p>

<p>General Gaines, the United States' officer in that quarter,
made a demand to deliver up the authors of these outrages,
but the Indians refused to comply. In consequence of this
refusal, the Indians, who were still on the lands ceded to
the United States by the Creeks, in 1814, were placed at
the disposal of General Gaines, to remove them or not, as
he should see fit.</p>

<p>The general availed himself of his discretionary power
to take an Indian village called Fowl Town, near the
Florida line. In this undertaking, one man and one woman
were killed, and two women made prisoners. It was
executed by a detachment under Major Twiggs. A few
days after, a second detachment, who were on a visit to
the town to obtain property, were fired upon, and a skirmish
ensued, in which there was a loss of several on both sides.
Shortly after, a large party of Seminole Indians formed an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_663" id="Page_663">[Pg 663]</a></span>
ambuscade upon the Appalachicola river, attacked one of
the American boats, ascending near the shore, and killed,
wounded, and took the greater part of the detachment,
consisting of forty men, commanded by Lieutenant R. W.
Scott, of the seventh infantry. There were also on board,
killed or taken, seven women, the wives of soldiers. Six
of the detachment only escaped, four of whom were
wounded.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

   <p class="caption2">Attack of the Seminoles on Lieutenant Scott's Boats.</p>
</div>

<p>This event led to increased hostilities. Fort Scott, in
which General Gaines with about six hundred regular
soldiers was confined for a time, was openly attacked by a
large force of the enemy. General Andrew Jackson was
directed, December 26, to take the field. In connection
with this, he was authorized, if he deemed the force of
General Gaines to be insufficient to carry on the war, "to
call on the executives of the neighboring states for such an
additional militia force as he might deem requisite." General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_664" id="Page_664">[Pg 664]</a></span>
Jackson varied from the order addressed to him, by
sending out a circular to the patriots of West Tennessee,
inviting them, to the number of one thousand, to take up
arms with him against the Indians. The General's call
was promptly responded to, and the thousand volunteers
were, in due time, gathered to his standard.</p>

<p>In this affair, General Jackson was widely censured for
departing from the letter and spirit of his instructions;
although the apology offered, was the delay that would
have been caused, had the governor of Tennessee, who
was either at Knoxville or in the Cherokee nation, been
first called upon. The account of his proceedings, which
he sent to the secretary of war, seems to have met with
favor by the public authorities at Washington. The troops
thus raised, were joined by a number of friendly Creeks
under General M'Intosh. Meanwhile, it appears from the
instructions of the president to General Gaines, that the
war was to be prosecuted in Florida, only in the event of
the Indians fleeing into that country, and, in that case, the
Spanish authority was to be respected wherever it was
maintained. Jackson, however, did not conform to these
instructions, and particularly in regard to the interdiction
not to attack a Spanish fort, should any Indians take shelter
under one, which was also a matter of instruction. He
justified his non-compliance, in this case, on the ground that,
orders issued to one officer, could not be construed as orders
to his successor, without a special reference to the first&mdash;that
his orders were general and discretionary, and that
the circumstances contemplated by the orders to General
Gaines, never existed. The Indians were found sheltered
<i>within</i> a fort, and not merely under the protection of its
guns on the outside.</p>

<p>On the plan of warfare, which the American general
deemed it justifiable to act, he not only entered Florida in
pursuit of the Indians as they fled thither, but he forcibly
seized the Spanish garrison, St. Marks. While at St.
Marks, information was imparted to General Jackson, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_665" id="Page_665">[Pg 665]</a></span>
the governor of Pensacola was favoring the Indians; upon
which, although the executive had given instruction not to
attack a Spanish fort, he took up his march for the fort at
Pensacola, before which, after twenty days, he appeared
prepared to subdue it, at whatever expense it might cost.
The fortress was invested on the 25th of May, and, after a
bombardment and cannonading for two days, the garrison
surrendered prisoners of war. The officers of the government,
civil and military, were transported to Havana, and
a new government established for the province. These
matters being settled, General Jackson announced to the
secretary of war that the Seminole war was terminated,
and returned to his house at Nashville.</p>

   <p class="caption2">Taking the Fort at Pensacola.</p>
</div>

<p>The conduct of the general, in transcending his orders,
was made a subject of inquiry in the house of representatives,
and a report made disapproving of some parts of it
as arbitrary, unjustifiable, and dangerous in principle; and
the report was ably supported by Mr. Clay, of Kentucky,
and Mr. Johnson, of Virginia, and others, but opposed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_666" id="Page_666">[Pg 666]</a></span>
many other members. The inquiry disclosed several
highly arbitrary acts. Mr. Monroe caused the instructions
given on this occasion to be laid before Congress; and he
also gave orders immediately for the restoration of the
forts and places to the Spanish authorities.</p>

<p>General Jackson was, also, charged with undue severity,
in the execution of Arbuthnot and Ambrister, the Englishmen
before alluded to, whom he took in the territory. The
former he caused to be hung, and the other to be shot.
The punishment was summary, and without law; but the
executive found cause to excuse these acts on the consideration
of the peculiar exigency of the case. The great
popularity of the military commander was supposed to
have furnished a reason for no further proceedings or
inquiries into this affair.</p>

<p><i>Revision of the Tariff</i>.&mdash;A law was passed by congress,
on the subject of the tariff, in May, 1824, embracing the
revision and alteration of the tariff which had heretofore
existed. Except a slight protection to coarse cotton cloths,
nothing had been done to encourage the manufactures of
the country. The attention of the people had been, for a
long time, turned towards the subject, and congress had
debated it at different periods, but very little had been
effected. Such was the state of things from 1816 to 1824.
On the part of many citizens, great zeal had been manifested
in favor of manufactures among us. Numbers,
especially in the Northern and Eastern states, owing to the
impediments which existed in the prosecution of commerce
and navigation, by the restrictive measures of the government,
as well as by the war, had engaged in the business of
manufacturing. By their energy, perseverance, and economy,
they had attained to a measure of success; but still,
some public enactments were wanting to give due encouragement
to the general interests of manufactures. The
well-known favorable opinion of the president, as also the
growing interest felt by the people on the subject, produced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_667" id="Page_667">[Pg 667]</a></span>
their effect in calling to it the attention of the national legislature,
to some practical purpose.</p>

<p>At the period above named, congress imposed higher
duties on several articles of import, chiefly of the description
of those then manufactured in the United States. On
several articles, a duty of five per cent. was laid, in addition
to that before imposed, though the act met a very
powerful opposition. The debate on the bill occupied the
house of representatives more than ten weeks, and the bill
was passed by a majority of only five. It was opposed by
those who were concerned in commerce, on the ground
that it would prove detrimental to their particular interests.
It was opposed by those who were concerned in agriculture,
from the consideration that an undue profit was
secured by it to the manufacturers. On the part of some,
it was a ground of opposition that it would greatly diminish
imports, and thus lessen the public revenue. A portion of
the national legislature, who were professedly in favor of
encouraging manufactures, believed that they were already
sufficiently protected. This opposition was principally by
members from the Southern states, where no manufactures
were established, and who believed that additional duties
on imports would operate unequally in different parts of
the union.</p>

<p>But notwithstanding the strong opposition to the measure,
the bill of the house passed the senate with several alterations,
by a vote of twenty-five to twenty-one. The measure,
when put to the test of experiment, proved effectual
in affording the desired protection to the articles which it
embraced; but the same legislation was wanted in regard
to others, perhaps equally important to the comfort, defence,
and independence of the country.</p>

<p><i>Visit of Lafayette.</i>&mdash;The arrival of the Marquis de Lafayette
into the United States, signalized the year 1824.
It was an event of great interest to the people of the country.
As the friend, benefactor, and ally of the Americans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_668" id="Page_668">[Pg 668]</a></span>
during the Revolution, he was remembered with lively
gratitude after his return to his native land, and his subsequent
history had been traced by many among us with
deep concern, as well as admiration. Nearly half a century
had elapsed, since he came as a youthful, devoted
adventurer to our shores, in the cause of freedom, and age
was now stealing over him with its usual effects on the
human frame. Before the close of life, he wished once
more to revisit the scenes of his early conflicts; and, having
intimated his intention of coming to this country, the people
were prepared to give him a welcome and enthusiastic
reception.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

   <img src="images/illus-671.jpg" alt="Landing of Lafayette at Castle Garden." title="Landing of Lafayette at Castle Garden."/>
   <p class="caption2">Landing of Lafayette at Castle Garden.</p>
</div>

<p>He landed at New York, on the 16th of August, accompanied
by his son, and M. L. Vasseur, his secretary. His
entrance into the city was more than a Roman triumphal
procession. Splendid as it was, it was more remarkable as
the tribute of the concentrated heart of America, in its great
commercial capital. He was met by one universal burst of
grateful enthusiasm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_669" id="Page_669">[Pg 669]</a></span></p>

<p>In the course of about a year, he visited each of the
twenty-four states, and most of the principal cities of the
land, and was every where received with the like spirit of
enthusiasm and gratitude.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="illus-672.jpg" id="illus-672.jpg"></a>
   <img src="images/illus-672.jpg" alt="Lafayette laying the Corner-stone." title="Lafayette laying the Corner-stone."/>
   <p class="caption2">Lafayette laying the Corner-stone.</p>
</div>

<p>He was present on the occasion of laying the corner-stone
of the Bunker hill monument, and assisted, as was
most befitting he should, in laying its corner-stone. His
presence added greatly to the interest of the occasion, and
long will it be remembered with what enthusiasm his presence
was greeted.</p>

<p>"When the time arrived which he had fixed as the termination
of his visit, it was thought most fitting that his
departure from the country should take place from the
capital. A frigate was prepared at that place, and named,
in compliment to him, the Brandywine, to transport him to
his native country. The few weeks spent, upon the invitation
of the president, as the guest of the nation, in the national
palace, were appropriated to taking leave of those venerable
men who had shared with him, both in establishing the independence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_670" id="Page_670">[Pg 670]</a></span>
of the country, and in receiving all the appropriate
honors which the people could bestow. He had previously
visited and taken leave of the venerable Adams; he now in
succession took leave of the other ex-presidents, the illustrious
author of the declaration of independence; the able
supporter and advocate of the federal constitution; and the
soldier of the Revolution, who had shed his blood in the
same cause with Lafayette."</p>

   <p class="caption2">Lafayette at the tomb of Washington.</p>
</div>

<p>His departure, which was from the seat of government,
on the 7th of September, 1825, was affecting in the highest
degree, but it needs not here to be described. Suffice it to
say, that in passing down the Potomac, he landed to pay
a farewell visit to the tomb of Washington; then, proceeding
on his way, he made a safe and prosperous voyage to France.</p>

<p><i>General Review of Mr. Monroe's Administration, his
Character, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;As has been already remarked, under the
administration of Mr. Monroe, there existed a propitious
state of things. The wisdom and practical foresight of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_671" id="Page_671">[Pg 671]</a></span>
Mr. Monroe were manifested in the measures of his administration.
Profound peace continued through the whole of
it, the amicable relations of the country with other nations
having been carefully cherished. Of the national debt, not
less than sixty millions were paid. The Floridas were not
only peaceably acquired, but the western boundaries of our
country were so settled as to give it the width of a continent.
He effected the repeal of the internal taxes, reduced
the military establishment to the smallest compass consistent
with safety, and brought the army under an efficient organization.
The asperity of party spirit yielding in a great
degree, he was enabled to carry most of those measures
which he deemed necessary to the public welfare. Progress
was made in the suppression of the slave-trade, the civilization
of the Indians advanced, and the independence of the
South American nations recognized.</p>

<p>As to the character of President Monroe, there seems to
be scarcely a dissenting opinion. His feelings, manners,
and principles, appeared to be adapted eminently for conciliation.
Nearly all united under him and with him in
carrying out the public enactments. "He was not so great
a philosopher as Jefferson, nor so learned as Madison; but
he possessed a more practical knowledge, or was more
desirous of pursuing that which was useful, than of adopting
new theories, or of supporting his own speculative views in
opposition to public opinion. He faithfully strove to defend
and promote the great interests of the republic; but sought
not for impracticable good in ways discovered only to his
contemplative imagination." Fisher Ames' lively, but perhaps
too severe, remark concerning Mr. Jefferson, that "he
strains his optics to look beyond its (the world's) circumference,
and contemplates invisibility till he thinks nothing
else is real," has no application to Mr. Monroe, though the
latter was of the same school of politics. To continue the
quotation first presented, "He (Mr. Monroe) had as much
regard for humanity, and was as sincere a lover of his kind,
as Mr. Jefferson; but he followed more truly the beaten path<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_672" id="Page_672">[Pg 672]</a></span>
of common sense, and adhered more cautiously to the plain
maxims sanctioned by experience, and shown by past history
to be essential to the welfare of society."</p>

<p><i>Election of John Quincy Adams.</i>&mdash;It being understood
that, according to the example of his predecessors, Mr. Monroe
would retire at the expiration of his second term, the
subject of his successor was early introduced to the nation.
Several candidates were put in nomination, and the claims
of each were duly urged by their respective friends and
supporters. The following was the electoral vote, according
to the official count before the two houses of congress:</p>

<p>The policy and views of Mr. Adams were, in the main,
conformed to those of his immediate predecessor. As
secretary of state under Mr. Monroe, it is believed that no
important measures were adopted without the advice or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_674" id="Page_674">[Pg 674]</a></span>
consent of Mr. Adams. He would, of course, have been
apt to continue in the same general line of conduct. His
qualifications were of the highest order; he well understood
the interests of his country, and was skilled in every art of
diplomacy and government.</p>

<p>On one point, perhaps, he differed in theory from Mr.
Monroe. He expressed less regard for state rights, or
allowed more power to the general government, according
to his construction of the constitution, than Mr. Monroe
did. The latter considered the United States' government
strictly <i>federal</i>; the former viewed it rather as a consolidated
or national one. In their public measures, however,
this difference of opinion did not often lead to the exercise
of greater power by one than the other. The constitution
was the guide of both; but one might approve an act of
congress for internal improvements, from which the other
would probably have withheld his assent, from scruples as
to the constitutional authority of the federal government
for such enterprises.</p>

<p>The administration of Mr. Adams was, however, destined
to be confronted by a very formidable opposition. This
was from the beginning, on the part of numbers&mdash;they
were determined to dislike his measures, whether right or
wrong, as they differed with him in matters of opinion, and
were dissatisfied with some circumstances attending his
election. It was alleged that the latter was brought about
by corruption. This state of things constituted a second
era of political asperity in the history of our government,
which has not subsided to this day. But the constitution
has happily survived the shock, though, at the present time,
it begins to be assailed by the more dangerous spirit of
sectional divisions. Another portion of Mr. Adams' political
opponents, more honest or honorable than the rest, were
willing to judge him by his acts. "It is but justice to add,
that the charge of a bargain between Mr. Adams and Mr.
Clay has not been satisfactorily supported. On the contrary,
it seems now to be generally admitted that no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_675" id="Page_675">[Pg 675]</a></span>
alliance had been formed between these gentlemen, previous
to the election which issued in Mr. Adams' accession."</p>

<p>The following are the principal topics upon which we
propose to dwell in noticing the administration of Mr.
Adams, viz:</p>

<p><i>Controversy respecting the removal of the Creeks.</i>&mdash;At
the commencement of Mr. Adams' term of office, a controversy
arose between the general government and the state
of Georgia, respecting the territory occupied by the Creek
Indians. There had long been a dispute between these
people and the Georgia state government, which claimed
the lands on which the Creeks resided. The claim was
professedly founded on a compact into which the United
States entered with Georgia, in 1802, of extinguishing, at
the national expense, the Indian title to these lands, and of
removing the natives, "as soon as it could be done peaceably,
and on reasonable terms." The consideration, on the
part of Georgia, was the relinquishment of her claim to
the Mississippi territory. Georgia was impatient to have
the compact fulfilled&mdash;the Indians, having grown more
attached to their homes, refused to alienate their territory.
Between the vehemence of Georgia and the resistance of
the Creeks, the general government had a difficult task to
perform. As it had been invariably desirous of observing
good faith with the Indian tribes, and had treated them with
much lenity and kindness, it was fully disposed to do justice
to the Creeks, while it was equally desirous to satisfy
Georgia. Before the government could extinguish the
Indian claim in the manner before agreed upon, i. e. "peaceably,
and on reasonable terms," the governor of Georgia
insisted on the removal of the tribe, and threatened to take
possession of the territory by force. It was in contemplation,
however, on the part of the federal executive, to resort
to force to prevent these proceedings on the part of Georgia.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_676" id="Page_676">[Pg 676]</a></span>
The danger of a collision, at one time, appeared to be
imminent. The national executive, nevertheless, by his
prompt and vigilant measures, passed through the crisis
with safety, and effected successfully the object in view.</p>

   <p class="caption2">Removal of the Creek Indians.</p>
</div>

<p>A treaty, which had been made with a party of the
Indians just before Mr. Adams entered upon his office, by
which all the Creek lands in Georgia and Alabama were
ceded to the United States, and which had been sanctioned
by the senate on the last day of the session, was virtually
set aside. Upon a more dispassionate consideration, it had
appeared not to have been executed in good faith, and
accordingly a new treaty was concluded at Washington,
through great effort on the part of the public authorities.
This was entered into with the chiefs of the Creek tribe, in
March, 1826. It stipulated for the payment of a large
sum to the tribe, and to guaranty the lands not expressly
ceded by them. Congress sanctioned the treaty and its
stipulations, though the members from Georgia expressed
their dissent on record. The conduct of Mr. Adams, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_677" id="Page_677">[Pg 677]</a></span>
this difficult and perplexing affair, was approved very generally
in congress, and throughout the country.</p>

<p><i>Proposed Mission to the Congress at Panama.</i>&mdash;The
president having been invited to send commissioners to the
congress of Panama, which had for its object the cementing
of the friendly relations of all the independent states of
America, saw fit to accept the invitation. Having nominated
Richard C. Anderson and John Sergeant, as ministers
on the part of the United States, and William B.
Rochester, of New York, as secretary, he presented these
names to the senate for confirmation. This step awakened
a spirit of animosity against the president, and a long and
angry debate ensued; but the nominations were eventually
confirmed, and the necessary appropriations voted. Measures
were soon taken to carry this policy into effect, and
directions were sent to Mr. Anderson, who was then in
Columbia, to attend the congress, which was to be convened
in the beginning of summer. But he was cut down by a
malignant fever before he could reach the place. Mr.
Sergeant was prevented from going, on account of the
lateness of the period at which his appointment was made.</p>

<p>This failure of representation at the congress, on the
part of the United States, was, by many, deemed auspicious,
as the relations and interests of the country might
otherwise have been compromitted; but others thought differently,
and believed that a conference of the kind might
issue in the adoption of a friendly and enlightened policy
between the parties.</p>

<p><i>Internal Improvements.</i>&mdash;In 1826, a proposition was
made in congress to expend a sum of money for repairing
and extending the Cumberland road. An act had been
passed long before, during Mr. Jefferson's second presidential
term, for making a road from Cumberland, in the
state of Maryland, or near that place, and on the north
bank of the Potomac river, to the river Ohio. Hence the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_678" id="Page_678">[Pg 678]</a></span>
name of the road. After having been commenced, money
was appropriated, at different periods, to finish and repair
the road. It was considered of great national advantage
and convenience, inasmuch as it furnished a commodious
way from the Atlantic slope to the Ohio river and to the
great valley of the Mississippi.</p>

<p>To the proposition above alluded to for an additional
sum of money, opposition was made at the present time.
The amount asked was eighty thousand dollars, for repairs
and also for its continuance farther west; for it was considered
as proper to extend it to a remoter point, as to have
made it to the Ohio river. The sum was named in a general
appropriation bill. Many were opposed, on account
of their doubts respecting the authority of congress to
expend money for such objects. Others, however, who
were reluctant to vote money for internal improvements on
general principles, were in favor of the appropriation in
this instance, as it would be of great public utility, and as
the road, in order to be used with facility, must be repaired.</p>

<p>"The vote, at this time, for an appropriation to repair the
Cumberland road, indicated the views of members of congress
on the subject of internal improvements; for it was
long discussed, and several members went fully into the
constitutionality of this and several measures. In the senate,
the votes were twenty-three in favor and fifteen
against the appropriation. And, in the house of representatives,
they were ninety-two to sixty-three. And, at
the same session, congress authorized the executive to subscribe,
on the part of the government, for shares in the Dismal
Swamp canal, so called, within the state of Virginia,
to the amount of sixty thousand dollars; which was a direct
recognition of the power of congress to construct works
for the public convenience. An act was also passed for a
survey in Florida, with a view to construct a canal across
the peninsula, from the Atlantic to the Gulf of Mexico."<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p><i>The Fiftieth Anniversary of American Independence.</i>&mdash;This
was a day long to be remembered in the annals of the
nation. The exultation of feeling throughout the country,
that we had reached in safety the fiftieth anniversary of our
independence, was great. The day was every where celebrated
with more than the usual demonstrations of joy. But
the most striking feature of the occasion, was the simultaneous
deaths of two ex-presidents of the United States,
John Adams and Thomas Jefferson. The coincidence in
their departure from life was certainly remarkable, more
especially as having occurred at that particular juncture.
It would seem to have been a providential dispensation,
designed to answer some important purpose; perhaps to
awaken the great principles of political freedom and equal
rights, to the maintenance of which the lives of both were
consecrated. They had both&mdash;and equally, perhaps&mdash;acted
a most conspicuous part on the theatre of the world,
and especially in the affairs of American independence.
"Both had been presidents, both had lived to great age,
both were early patriots, and both were distinguished and
ever honored by their immediate agency in the act of independence.
It cannot but seem striking and extraordinary,
that these two should live to see the fiftieth year from the
date of that act; that they should complete that year, and
that then, on the day which had fast linked for ever their
own fame with their country's glory, the heavens should
open to receive them both at once. As their lives themselves
were the gifts of Providence, who is not willing to
recognize in their happy termination, as well as in their
long continuance, proofs that our country and its benefactors
are objects of his care?"</p>

<p>Although they belonged to different schools in politics,
and were separated, for a time, by the party distinctions
which prevailed soon after the constitution went into operation,
yet they seemed to have coalesced very much in
views and feelings in the latter portion of their lives.
Friendly letters, of great interest, passed between them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_680" id="Page_680">[Pg 680]</a></span>
which were given to the public at the time. But the coincidences
or parallel circumstances attending these distinguished
men are not yet exhausted. "They belonged to
the same profession, and had pursued its studies and its
practice, for unequal lengths of time indeed, but with diligence
and effect. Both were learned and able lawyers.
They were natives and inhabitants respectively of those
two of the colonies, which, at the Revolution, were the
largest and most powerful, and which, naturally, had a lead
in the political affairs of the times. When the colonies
became, in some degree, united, by the assembling of the
general congress, they were brought to act together in its
deliberations, not indeed at the same time, but both at early
periods. Each had already manifested his attachment to
the cause of the country, as well as his ability to maintain
it, by pointed addresses, public speeches, extensive correspondence,
and whatever other mode could be adopted for
the purpose of exposing the encroachments of the British
parliament, and animating the people to manly resistance.
Both were not only decided, but early friends of independence.
While others yet doubted, they were resolved;
where others hesitated, they pressed forward. They were
both members of the committee for preparing the Declaration
of Independence; they constituted the sub-committee,
appointed by the other members to make the draft. They
left their seats in congress, being called to other public
employments, at periods not remote from each other,
although one of them returned to it, afterwards, for a short
time. Neither of them was of the assembly of great men
which formed the present constitution, and neither was at
any time member of congress under its provisions. Both
have been public ministers abroad, both vice-presidents, and
both presidents." These coincidences were surprisingly
completed, as already mentioned, by their simultaneous
deaths, and that on the anniversary of liberty.</p>

<p><i>Introduction of the "American System."</i>&mdash;The phrase<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_681" id="Page_681">[Pg 681]</a></span>
"American System" was given to the policy advocated by
many, of protecting, by impost duties, the manufactures of
the country against foreign competition. It began to be
employed during the administration of Mr. Adams. Additional
duties were sought by the friends of manufactures on
woolen goods, and a bill for that purpose passed both
houses of congress, in the months of April and May, 1827.
The measure, however, seemed not to be satisfactory to
the country at large. "The president was in favor of
affording protection to domestic manufactures generally,
and of woolens particularly, which, at this time, was the
leading question in political economy, so far as the federal
government was believed to have authority to interfere.
But he was also friendly to extensive enterprises in commerce
and navigation, and expressed no opinion in support
of the ultra doctrines of the manufacturers."</p>

<p><i>Election of General Jackson.</i>&mdash;The administration of
Mr. Adams encountered strong and determined opposition.
The circumstance of his rival, General Jackson, having
had a larger popular vote than himself, and having, in congress,
only a small majority, when elected to office, seemed,
in the view of the democratic party, quite sufficient to
justify a more than usual distrust of his administration,
from its beginning. Mr. Adams was watched with singular
vigilance, and every advantage taken to render his acts
unpopular. It was early charged against him, that a corrupt
bargain had been made with Mr. Clay, his secretary
of state. The Panama mission was represented as a measure
weak and injudicious. And, moreover, it was charged
that his administration was wasteful and extravagant.</p>

<p>Of the falsity and injustice of these charges, it is now
unnecessary to speak. They were a part of an organized
system of opposition, and designed to prevent the rëelection
of Mr. Adams, and secure that of General Jackson.
In this design, the friends of the latter succeeded, the vote
of the electors for president affording a victory to his supporters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_682" id="Page_682">[Pg 682]</a></span>
as gratifying as the defeat of the friends of the
former was mortifying.</p>

<p>In his inaugural address, General Jackson exhibited, in
comprehensive terms, his views in regard to the administration
of the government. He spoke of the limitations and
extent of executive power&mdash;the peace and friendship to be
cultivated with foreign powers&mdash;the respect due to the
rights of the separate states&mdash;the solicitude to be exercised
in the management of the public revenue&mdash;the equal fostering
care of the general government in respect to agriculture,
commerce, and manufactures&mdash;the necessity of <i>reform</i>, and
the correction of certain abuses&mdash;the attention to be given
to internal improvement and the diffusion of knowledge&mdash;the
policy to be observed towards the Indian tribes within
our borders&mdash;and other similar topics.</p>

<p>He expressed, also, the diffidence he felt on assuming the
high and responsible station to which he had been elevated,
and the reverence with which he regarded the examples of
public virtue left us by his illustrious predecessors; hoping
at the same time to receive instruction and aid from the
cöordinate branches of the government, and the indulgence
and support of his fellow-citizens in general. It was a brief
and terse address, and manifested the characteristic decision
and fearlessness of the man.</p>

<p>A sketch of the more prominent measures and events of
General Jackson's administration will require us to notice
the following topics, viz:</p>

<p><i>Condition of the Country.</i>&mdash;A high degree of prosperity
was enjoyed in the United States at this era. The administration
of General Jackson's predecessor had been crowned
with signal success. Circumstances, however, connected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_685" id="Page_685">[Pg 685]</a></span>
with the election of Mr. Adams were seized upon as a
ground of attack; and, in the eye of many, all that he afterwards
did, as the executive of the nation, was unnaturally
colored or distorted. But the results showed that his administration
had been conducted with wisdom, integrity, and
vigor. During the whole course of it, uninterrupted peace
had been enjoyed; our commercial relations had been gradually
extended; and, in many instances, the claims of American
citizens upon foreign governments had been prosecuted
with success. At home, the marks of an able administration
were exhibited, in the increased activity imparted to the
legitimate powers of the federal government for the development
of the resources of the country, and the increase
of its wealth and respectability.</p>

<p><i>Georgia and the Cherokees.</i>&mdash;The president, in his message
on the 8th of December, 1829, had presented, at considerable
length, his views in regard to the disposal of the
Indian tribes within the limits of the United States. He
recommended their removal beyond the boundary of the
different states, but without compulsion, to such territory
west of the Mississippi, as congress might set apart for their
use. In this, he wished to avoid the difficulties arising from
the treaties between the United States and these Indians,
and the opposing claims of the states within whose limits
the Indians resided. This was one of the most embarrassing
subjects which demanded the attention of the new
administration. It was especially applicable to the relation
which the Cherokees, a powerful tribe within the limits of
Georgia, sustained to the general government.</p>

<p>Treaties had been made with this tribe, from time to time,
ever since the adoption of the federal constitution. In these
treaties, the protection of the United States was promised
them, and the territory they inhabited was acknowledged to
be theirs. But the government had also acknowledged the
limits of Georgia, and had agreed to extinguish the Indian
title whenever it could be peaceably effected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_686" id="Page_686">[Pg 686]</a></span></p>

<p>Georgia, in her anxiety to secure the Indian territory, had
passed laws from time to time, with reference to that object,
claiming exclusive civil and criminal jurisdiction over the
Indians. In this state of things, the new administration
came in, and the views of the president coinciding with
those of the state of Georgia, a change was made in her
mode of procedure. She was allowed, with the approbation
of the general government, to extend her laws over the
Cherokees, and to consider the treaties of the United States
with them, guaranteeing their territory, as unconstitutional
and void.</p>

<p>In conformity to the president's proposal of removing the
Indians, as already alluded to, a bill was submitted to both
houses of congress, in February, 1830, authorizing the president
to set apart such portion as he should deem necessary
of the public territory west of the Mississippi, to be divided
into districts, for the permanent residence of the emigrating
Indians. The bill underwent a thorough and spirited debate,
and was finally passed by both houses, by a small majority.</p>

<p>The laws of Georgia had come into direct conflict with
those of the United States, but this bill seemed to release
the president from the duty of enforcing the acts of the
latter, and observing the faith of treaties, as it was also in
agreement with his determination not to regard either, in
reference to a sovereign state. Encouraged by the acts of
the government and the views of the president, Georgia
proceeded to assert entire sovereignty over the Indians
within its limits, issued writs of the state courts against the
residents in the Indian territories, and tried the Cherokees
before the tribunals of the state. At length, even the missionaries
of the American board, residing and laboring
among them, were arrested, tried, condemned and imprisoned,
for refusing to obtain a permit from the government
of Georgia to reside within the territory, or to take an oath
of allegiance to the state. And, to consummate their high-handed
proceedings, the decision of the supreme judicial
tribunal of the United States, pronouncing the acts of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_687" id="Page_687">[Pg 687]</a></span>
Georgia legislature null and void, being unconstitutional,
was resisted by the state. What might have ensued from
this condition of affairs, had the general government undertaken
to enforce the decision of the supreme court of the
nation, as it would have been its imperious duty, it is needless
to say. The missionaries relieved Georgia from the
dreaded calamity, by informing the governor that they had
instructed their counsel to prosecute the case no further.
Soon after this, the missionaries were set at liberty.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all the stringent measures of Georgia,
the Cherokees were determined to remain in the land of
their fathers. But at length, in 1835, a few of their chiefs
were induced to sign a treaty for the sale of their lands and
a removal west of the Mississippi. Although this treaty
was opposed by a majority of the Cherokees, and the terms
afterwards decided upon at Washington rejected, yet, as
the state of Georgia was determined in its hostility, and
they could expect no protection, according to the new doctrine,
from the general government, they finally decided
upon a removal; but it was not until the close of the year
1838, that the task of emigration was completed.</p>

<p><i>Public Lands.</i>&mdash;Questions pertaining to the public lands
were earnestly debated at this period. These lands form
an immense domain, and lie on both sides of the Mississippi,
though much the larger portion lies on the west of that
river. Applying the Georgia doctrine, in reference to the
sovereignty of the state over all land within its limits, some
of the new states, formed out of the public domain, set up a
claim to the property in the soil of all lands not owned by
individuals, as an element of sovereignty. The mode of
disposing of these lands, was complained of in other states,
and attempts were made to throw doubt on the validity of
the title of the general government to that portion within
the limits of states.</p>

<p>A resolution of Mr. Foot, of Connecticut, on this subject,
gave rise to animated discussion in the senate, on the 29th of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_688" id="Page_688">[Pg 688]</a></span>
December, 1829. In the course of the debate, Mr. Hayne,
of South Carolina, introduced the subject of state rights,
and contended that the several states within which the
public lands were situated, should have the entire control
and jurisdiction over them. Mr. Webster, of Massachusetts,
replied to Mr. Hayne in one of the most eloquent and
effective speeches ever delivered in congress, and contended
that on subjects fully committed to the government by the
constitution, its powers were absolute, exclusive, and unlimited;
that no state, nor even a number of states, might
justly interfere in such cases; and that the public lands not
expressly ceded to a particular state, were solely and absolutely
at the disposal of the United States' government.
This speech destroyed, for a time, the hopes of the advocates
of the novel doctrine of nullification; yet the views of Mr.
Hayne, respecting state rights and powers, continued to be
entertained by a large portion of the people of the Southern
states. No particular law resulted from this able and prolonged
discussion.</p>

<p><i>National Bank.</i>&mdash;In anticipation of a request for the
renewal of the charter of the United States' bank, the president,
in his message to congress, had expressed opinions
adverse to that measure. But the standing committees of
the senate and house, to which that portion of his message
referred, made reports in opposition to the president's views.
The friends of the administration formed a majority in both
committees, and it was readily perceived how little harmony
of action there was likely to be, on that subject, between the
president and the party which had brought him into power.</p>

<p>About four years anterior to the expiration of the existing
charter, that is, in December, 1832, a memorial was presented
to congress from the president and directors of the
United States' bank, for a renewal of its charter. This
memorial was referred to a select committee, which, on the
13th of March following, reported in its favor, recommending
only some limitations to the power of issuing notes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_689" id="Page_689">[Pg 689]</a></span>
holding real property; also, the payment of a bonus of one
million five hundred thousand dollars. After long debates,
and various amendments, a bill for this purpose was carried
in the senate by a vote of twenty-eight to twenty, and in
the house by a vote of one hundred and seven to eighty-five;
but, being on the 4th of July sent to the president, it
was returned to the senate on the 10th of July with an
absolute veto, which, not being opposed by two-thirds,
decided the fate of the bank.</p>

<p><i>Internal Improvements.</i>&mdash;The policy of the government
from an early period, though not from the beginning, had
favored works of internal improvement, so that it seemed
to be settled as a feature of each successive administration,
from Mr. Jefferson to the present period. From General
Jackson's own votes, while he was a member of the senate,
it might reasonably be inferred that the same policy
would be coincident with his views as president. But such
was found not to be the fact. The question of internal
improvements by the general government, was earnestly
discussed at the first session of the twenty-first congress,
and a bill was passed in the house, by a vote of one hundred
and two to thirty-five, in the senate by twenty-four to
eighteen, authorizing a subscription to the stock of the
Maysville and Lexington road company, in Kentucky.
The bill thus passed by so large a majority, was sent to
the president for his approval. After retaining it eight
days, he returned it to the house, on the 27th of May, 1830,
with his objections.</p>

<p>The reading of this veto message produced much excitement
in congress. Many of the friends of the president
from Pennsylvania and from the Western states, had confidently
looked for his approbation of the bill. Their
surprise and disappointment were equally great. The
question being taken upon the passage of the bill, notwithstanding
the objections of the president, the vote stood, yeas
ninety-six, nays ninety-four. Two-thirds of the house not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_690" id="Page_690">[Pg 690]</a></span>
agreeing to pass the bill, it was rejected, though a majority of
the house refused to sustain the objections of the president.</p>

<p><i>Indian Hostilities.</i>&mdash;The year 1832 was distinguished by
a series of Indian hostilities, commonly known as "Black
Hawk's War," from the name of the celebrated Indian
chief, who was the leader of the Sac and Fox Indians in
these hostilities. These tribes, together with the Winnebagoes,
had, for a considerable time, manifested a restless
disposition, and appeared evidently disposed to commence
hostilities, as opportunity might offer. They had joined the
British in the war of 1812, and inflicted much injury on the
Americans. Encouraged by the friendship of the British,
as well as incited by their own warlike propensities, the
Sacs and Foxes claimed the right of occupying a part of
the country upon Rock river, even after it had been sold to
the citizens of the United States, and the latter had made
settlements upon it. In attempting to assert this right,
frequent collisions ensued; and, as no persuasions on the
part of the agents of the government could induce them to
be quiet, and confine themselves to their own country on
the west of the Mississippi, measures were taken to compel
them to desist from their aggressions. As early as 1831, a
considerable detachment of the army, and also of the militia
of Illinois, was called into the field; upon which, the Indians
agreed to confine themselves within their own proper limits.</p>

<p>In a short time, however, this arrangement was violated
by a party of these Indians, in an outrage committed upon
a band of friendly Menomonies, in the very vicinity of Fort
Crawford. Twenty-five persons were wantonly killed and
many wounded, while encamped in the village of Prairie
du Chien, under the protection of our flag. It was felt by
the government, that this aggression could not be passed
over without the infliction of a due chastisement; as all
was at stake, in regard to the friendly Indians and the
frontier settlements in that quarter. Accordingly, the
department ordered General Atkinson, on the 7th of March,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_691" id="Page_691">[Pg 691]</a></span>
1832, to ascend the Mississippi with the disposable regular
troops at Jefferson barracks, and to strengthen the frontiers;
orders were also given for the rëoccupation of Chicago.</p>

<p>In the prosecution of his instructions, General Atkinson
proceeded to the Indian country, where, after various skirmishes,
and several more serious engagements, the Sacs
and Foxes, under the direction of Black Hawk, fled beyond
the Mississippi. On the 28th and 29th of July, General
Atkinson crossed with his army to the north side of the
Wisconsin, at Helena, in pursuit of the enemy. After a
most difficult and forced march, over steep mountains and
through deep ravines, on the 5th day of March, the enemy
was announced by one of the scouts. A suitable disposition
was made of the American forces, with a view to
prevent the escape of any of the foe, and the firing commenced,
as the different portions of the army came in
contact with him. The battle lasted upwards of three
hours. About fifty of his women and children were taken
prisoners, and many were killed in the battle. When the
Indians were driven to the bank of the Mississippi, some
hundreds of the men, women, and children plunged into
the river, and hoped, by diving, to escape the bullets.
Very few, however, escaped&mdash;the American sharp-shooter
is nearly infallible in his aim.</p>

<p>Black Hawk, in the midst of the battle, escaped, and
went up the river. The savages, after this defeat, became
convinced of the impossibility of contending, with success,
against the American arms. No further serious resistance
was offered on their part, and the war soon closed by the
capture of Black Hawk, who was delivered up to the
American commander, by two Winnebagoes, on the 27th
of August. He was well treated and much noticed in the
United States.</p>

<p><i>Discontent in South Carolina.</i>&mdash;The year 1832 was
distinguished also by discontents in the Southern portion
of the country, particularly in South Carolina, arising from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_692" id="Page_692">[Pg 692]</a></span>
the tariff of 1828. That tariff had been slightly modified
by an act of congress, in the summer of 1832. But the
small and partial reduction of duties thus secured, did not
diminish, but rather served to increase the opposition to
the American System, then so called. By this system was
meant the policy of high duties on imports, for the protection
of domestic manufactures.</p>

<p>In South Carolina, it was resolved, a few months after the
passage of the law of July, 1832, by the legislature, that
the present law, and that of 1828, were infractions of the
constitution, or exceeded the power given to the federal
government by that compact, and were, therefore, null and
void; and that the execution of those acts, within the state,
was to be prevented, even by force, if necessary. And the
requisite measures were taken to enforce this resolution.</p>

<p>An issue was thus brought on between the state and
federal government, that imperiously demanded attention.
The very existence of the government depended on the
decision of the president. South Carolina had set at
defiance the supreme authority of the Union, and declared
that no umpire should be admitted to decide between the
contending parties. In such an exigency, the president felt
that there was no room for hesitation. The difficulty must
be met, not only to save the Union from dismemberment, or
the loss of one of its constituent parts, but to protect those
citizens of South Carolina, who still adhered to the Union,
from the horrors of civil discord. The president, with his
personal courage and indomitable will, as also clothed with
the irresistible power of the Union, determined to throw
himself into the breach, and to enforce the revenue acts
with an entire disregard to the pretended rights of sovereignty,
which were assumed by the state of South Carolina.</p>

<p>To carry the determination of the government into effect,
all the disposable military force was ordered to assemble at
Charleston, and a sloop-of-war was sent to that port to
protect the federal officers, in case of necessity, in the
execution of their duties. On the 10th of December, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_693" id="Page_693">[Pg 693]</a></span>
proclamation of the president was issued, plainly and forcibly
stating the nature of the American government, and
the supremacy of the federal authorities in all matters
intrusted to their care. At the same time, in this document,
he exhorted the citizens of South Carolina not to
persist in a course which must bring upon their state the
force of the confederacy, and expose the Union to the
hazard of a dissolution.</p>

<p>The proclamation of General Jackson was a noble production.
It was hailed with delight throughout the country,
as well by his political opponents, as by his friends. "Perhaps
no document has emanated from the executive department
of the government, which has been more generally
approved, both in regard to the style in which it was
written, and the doctrines asserted and maintained, since
the farewell address of the first president. It contains no
speculative opinions, no new theories; it speaks the facts
of history, in the language of the constitution, and in the
spirit which we, of a later generation, may suppose animated
its framers."</p>

<p>The president, on this momentous occasion, was nobly
supported by the leaders of the opposition party in congress,
with Mr. Webster at their head. The force of public
opinion was irresistible&mdash;South Carolina was compelled to
shrink before it. No resistance was actually made to the
enforcement of the laws they had nullified, and, consequently,
no coercive measures were necessary on the part
of the general government to maintain its authority. The
objectionable laws were somewhat modified in the session
of 1833, by what was termed "the compromise act," proposed
by Mr. Clay; and South Carolina, though she has
steadfastly adhered to her theories, has been contented not
to reduce them to practice.</p>

<p><i>Rëelection of General Jackson.</i>&mdash;In the autumn of 1832,
the electors of the country were again convened in their
respective places of residence for the choice of a president.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_694" id="Page_694">[Pg 694]</a></span>
The two principal candidates were General Jackson and
Henry Clay. The friends of Mr. Calhoun, in South Carolina,
where the tariff question had already produced a
bitter feeling of hostility to the government, remained
almost entirely aloof from the contest. The anti-masonic
party in the Northern states, which had been recently
formed, supported William Wirt, of Maryland. The opponents
of General Jackson were strongly opposed to his
rëelection, and made great exertions to defeat it; but the
returns from the electoral colleges exhibited a large majority
in his favor. The following is the official result of the
electoral vote:</p>

<p><i>Removal of the Deposites.</i>&mdash;The law of 1816, which
created the United States' bank, required that the public
moneys should be deposited in that bank, subject to be
removed only by the secretary of the treasury, and requiring
him, in that case, to present his reasons for removing
them to congress. Congress had already refused to authorize
the removal of the deposites, and the president was now
resolved to effect it on his own responsibility. The new
secretary of the treasury, William J. Duane (for there had
been some recent changes in the cabinet), refusing to act in
this matter, and resigning his office, the attorney-general,
Roger B. Taney, was appointed in his place. Mr. Taney
immediately issued the necessary orders for the removal of
the deposites from the United States' bank; a measure
which resulted from the president's determination to break
off all connection between the government and the bank.</p>

<p>At the coming session of congress, 2d of December,
1833, one of the first acts of the senate was the adoption
of a resolution, by a vote of twenty-six to twenty, declaring
"that the president, in his late executive proceedings, in
relation to the public revenue, had assumed upon himself
authority and power not conferred by the constitution and
laws, but in derogation of both." This resolution remained
on the journal until January 15, 1837, when it was formally
expunged by order of the senate.</p>

<p>The act of the president, and the measures taken by the
United States' bank, occasioned much embarrassment
throughout the mercantile community, during the years
1834 and 1835. Committees, appointed by the merchants,
mechanics, and tradesmen of the principal commercial
cities, solicited the president to rëplace the government
deposites in the United States' bank. But he resisted every
solicitation. Many petitions were sent to congress on the
same subject. The senate favorably received them; but
the house saw fit to sustain the president in this measure.</p>

<p><i>Death of Lafayette.</i>&mdash;This illustrious man and benefactor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_696" id="Page_696">[Pg 696]</a></span>
of America, died at his residence, La Grange, in France,
on the 20th of May, 1834. This event was announced to
congress on the 21st of June, in a message from the president.
The character, services, and sacrifices of Lafayette,
as an apostle of liberty and lover of mankind, were spoken
of in appropriate terms of commendation in the president's
communication. A joint select committee, of both houses,
reported a series of resolutions, among which, one went to
request the president to address a letter of condolence to
the survivors in his family, and another to appoint John
Quincy Adams to deliver, at the next session of congress,
an oration on the life and character of the illustrious man.
In due time, Mr. Adams pronounced his eulogy, in which
the character and actions of Lafayette were drawn in a
masterly manner.</p>

<p><i>Deposite Act.</i>&mdash;The deposite or distribution act was
passed by congress in 1835. The president had given it
his "reluctant approval," with the apprehension of evil consequences
flowing from it. In a message to the subsequent
congress, he speaks of it as merely an act for the deposite
of the surplus moneys of the United States in the state
treasuries, for safe keeping, until wanted for the service of
the general government&mdash;but that it had been spoken of as
a <i>gift</i>, would be so considered, and might be so used. The
manifestation of the president's feelings, in regard to this
act and its disadvantages, was not calculated to relieve
the minds of some, as to what he might attempt, in order to
defeat its execution, or to prevent a future similar measure.
This apprehension was subsequently strengthened by certain
circumstances, which, however, need here no specific
mention. There was at least an apparent effort to obtain
control over the government funds, so as to divert them
from the channel directed by the act of congress.</p>

<p><i>Seminole War.</i>&mdash;The Seminole Indians of Florida, near
the close of the year 1835, commenced hostilities against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_697" id="Page_697">[Pg 697]</a></span>
the settlements of the whites in their neighborhood. To
this, they were incited by the attempt of the government
to remove the Indians to lands west of the Mississippi, in
accordance with the treaty of Payne's Landing, executed
in 1832. That treaty, however, the Indians denied to be
justly binding upon them, and they naturally felt a strong
reluctance to quit their homes for ever. Micanopy, the
king of the Seminoles, was opposed to the removal; and
Osceola, their most noted warrior, said he "wished to rest
in the land of his fathers, and his children to sleep by
his side."</p>

<p>Osceola was cruelly put in irons by General Thompson,
the government agent, who was displeased by the pretensions
of the chieftain, and his remonstrances against the
governmental proceedings. He, however, obtained his
liberty, at length, by dissembling his displeasure, and gave
his confirmation to the treaty of removal. The whites
were thus lulled into security; and, while they were
expecting the delivery of the cattle and horses of the
Indians, according to the treaty, the latter were already
commencing the work of devastation and death.</p>

<p>At this time, Major Dade was dispatched from Fort
Brooke, at the head of Tampa Bay, with upwards of an
hundred men, to the assistance of General Clinch, stationed
at Fort Drane, in the interior of Florida. The latter was
supposed to be in imminent danger. Dade had proceeded
only about half the distance, when he was suddenly
attacked by the enemy, and he and all, except four of his
men, were killed, and these four, terribly mangled, afterwards
died of their wounds.</p>

<p>At the time of this massacre, Osceola, with a small band
of warriors, was lurking in the vicinity of Fort King, about
sixty-five miles south-west from St. Augustine. Here
General Thompson and a few friends were dining at a
store near the fort, when Osceola and his band surprised
them by a sudden discharge of musketry, and five out of
nine were killed. The general was one of the slain, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_698" id="Page_698">[Pg 698]</a></span>
body having been pierced by fifteen bullets. The Indian
chief and his party then rushed in, scalped the dead, and
retreated before they could be fired upon from the fort.</p>

<p>There were other engagements about this time between
the Americans and the savages; and subsequently, upon the
junction of several of the Creek towns and tribes with the
Seminoles in the war, murders and devastations became
frequent. The Indians obtained possession of many of the
southern mail routes in Georgia and Alabama, attacked
steamboats, destroyed stages, burned a number of towns,
and compelled thousands of the whites, who had settled in
their territory, to abandon their homes. A strong force,
however, of confederate whites and friendly Indians, having
been sent against them, and several of the hostile chiefs
having been captured, the Creeks submitted, and, during the
summer of 1836, several thousands of them were transported
west of the Mississippi.</p>

<p>In October of the same year, Governor Call took command
of the American forces in Florida, and marched into
the interior with nearly two thousand men. At the Wahoo
swamp, not far from Dade's battle-ground, five hundred and
fifty of his troops attacked a large number of the enemy,
who, after a fierce contest of nearly half an hour, were dispersed,
with the loss of twenty warriors left dead on the
field. In a second engagement, the Americans lost nine
men killed and sixteen wounded. The combats of the
whites and Indians in Florida, at this period, seem to have
been attended with much loss of life on both sides.</p>

<p><i>Treasury Circular.</i>&mdash;An important circular, in relation
to the funds which should be received in payment for the
public lands, was issued from the treasury department on
the 11th of July, 1836. The purport of the circular was,
to instruct the receivers of the public money, after the 15th
day of August next ensuing, to receive in payment of the
public lands nothing except gold and silver, and in the
proper places, Virginia land scrip, in accordance with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_699" id="Page_699">[Pg 699]</a></span>
directions of the existing laws. In order to secure the
faithful execution of the requirements of the circular, all
receivers were strictly prohibited from accepting, for land
sold, any draft, certificate, or other evidence of money or
deposite, though for specie, unless signed by the treasurer
of the United States, in conformity to the act of April
25th, 1820.</p>

<p>At the next following session of congress, the president,
in his message, was pleased to represent this specie circular
as having produced many salutary consequences, contrary
to the views of a large portion of the citizens of the United
States, who believed that the embarrassment and disturbance
of the currency, so severely felt, were, in a great
measure, owing to the operation of that circular.</p>

<p><i>Character of General Jackson's Administration.</i>&mdash;It is
hardly to be anticipated, perhaps, that a full and impartial
estimate of General Jackson's administration, can be formed
during the present generation. There were many strong
points in it, and these are apt to call forth strong correspondent
feelings, whether of approbation or dislike. Men
differ, and may honestly differ, in regard to the propriety of
his conduct and the wisdom of his measures. That he was
honest, as a ruler, will not be at all doubted. That he was
self-willed, and determined to have his own way, will
scarcely less admit of a question.</p>

<p>Still, it is not too much to hope, that the services he
rendered to his country, connected though they be with the
stern and high-handed measures adopted by his indomitable
will, may be cherished with gratitude and respect. As a
statesman, he had clear views, and, in some instances, a
sort of prophetic foresight. When he had once determined
upon a particular course, where any important principle
was involved, he could not be made to swerve from what
he conceived to be just and right. As the element of fear
seemed not to be in him, he never shrunk from the discharge
of any public duty, and was always ready to avow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_700" id="Page_700">[Pg 700]</a></span>
any act of his administration, as in the instance of removal
of the public deposites through his secretary, and unshrinkingly
to abide the consequences.</p>

<p><i>Election of Martin Van Buren.</i>&mdash;General Jackson, in his
last annual message, signified his intention, at the expiration
of his term, to retire to private life. At the democratic convention
for nominating a successor, Mr. Van Buren received
a decided majority. The votes of the electoral colleges,
counted February 8th, 1837, showed the following result:</p>

<p>Prior to the elevation of Mr. Van Buren to the presidency,
he had been long in public life, and had been honored
with several offices in his native state and under the
general government. His talents, learning, and experience,
though not greater than those of many others of his countrymen,
were generally allowed to be adequate to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_702" id="Page_702">[Pg 702]</a></span>
station. He had not, indeed, like all his predecessors,
been connected more or less with the scenes of the Revolution,
for he was born in the concluding year of the war.
But, in the swiftly revolving years, it was evident that the
time must soon come, when others than the men of '76
would be called to the helm of government. New men,
and those not of the Anglo-American stock, must participate,
as agreeable to the will of our mixed community, in
guiding the ship of state which the fathers launched forth
on the sea of experiment. Such was the case in respect to
Mr. Van Buren, and such must it be hereafter, so far as
regards men of ante-revolutionary birth. Whether our
future presidents will continue to be guided by the spirit
and example of the sages and heroes of the Revolution,
remains to be seen.</p>

<p>In developing the administration of Mr. Van Buren, the
following topics will be noticed:</p>

<p><i>Measures respecting Banks, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;The embarrassments
in trade, consequent on the discontinuance of the Bank of
the United States, issued in a great and disastrous diminution
of the revenue. In this state of things, the administration
found it necessary to resort to large loans. The
people, as was to be expected, soon began to suffer in their
private enterprises, and the country throughout wore a
gloomy aspect, in respect to its pecuniary affairs and general
prosperity. This condition of things arose to a great
height, in the year 1837, and continued for some time afterwards.
"Over trading, or the unusual amount of importations,
was one cause to which this unprosperous state of
the country was imputed. But it was also attributed to
the discontinuance of the national bank, and to the repeated
attempts of the administration to destroy its influence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_703" id="Page_703">[Pg 703]</a></span>
Several petitions, from different commercial towns and
cities, with very numerous subscribers, were presented to
the president, requesting an early session of congress.
The president delayed, for some time, to act on the petitions;
but the distress increasing, and other petitions being
addressed to him, he issued a proclamation for convening
the national legislature in the month of September."</p>

<p>In his message, the president proposed what his opponents
termed the "sub-treasury scheme." He held out
very little hope of relief to the people from the government.
His opinion was, that the government could do
little more than take care of itself&mdash;that the class or classes
of the community who had suffered, could alone supply a
remedy, by a more prudent and limited course of enterprise
and trade. These, and similar suggestions, seemed
little calculated to satisfy a large portion of the people,
especially as the government had destroyed one important
means of benefit and facility to the merchants, and, through
them, to all the other classes of citizens.</p>

<p>Following the suggestions of Mr. Van Buren, congress
passed an act authorizing the issue of <i>treasury notes</i>, to the
amount of ten millions of dollars, for the immediate wants
of the government. "This was no other than a loan,
except in name. The notes were made negotiable, and
thus became, in fact, merely paper money; with no better
credit, for there was no greater capital, or certainty of
payment, than there had been in the national bank. The
like amount of treasury notes was authorized in 1838,
and again in 1839, but a part of former issues had been
redeemed."</p>

<p>The sub-treasury scheme, which the president had proposed
in his message, did not succeed at that time. The
measure was opposed not only by the adverse political
party, but by his democratic friends who were concerned
in banks, and it was, at that period, very unpopular. This
portion of the democratic party separated from the administration,
and were known as <i>conservatives</i>. They eventually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_704" id="Page_704">[Pg 704]</a></span>
fell into the ranks of the old opposition, or as it was
(and is still) termed, "the whig party." The subject of the
sub-treasury was postponed. At the opening of the session
of congress, in the following December, as may be
remarked in anticipation, Mr. Van Buren again pressed the
measure, which now seemed to be his favorite; but, though
carried in the senate, it was defeated in the house. In a
spirit of perseverance, he was enabled to effect the object,
through his political friends, at the next session, when, on
the 4th of July, 1840, the bill received his signature.</p>

<p>The extra session of congress seemed to satisfy neither
party. The friends of the administration viewed the causes
of the depression of business and the consequent distress, to
be overaction in business, arising from exclusive issues of
bank paper, and other facilities for the acquirement and
enlargement of credit; the contraction of a large foreign
debt, investment in unproductive lands, and vast internal
improvements; and they naturally wished the separation
of the government from the banks, in which project they
were for the present disappointed. The opponents of the
administration traced the causes of the pecuniary difficulties
of the country to the veto of the national bank; the
removal of the deposites, with the earnest injunction of the
secretary of the treasury upon the banks to enlarge their
accommodations; the gold bill and the demand of gold for
the foreign indemnities; the imperfect execution of the
deposite law; and the treasury order of July, 1836: and
they naturally desired some modification or counteraction
of these measures by legislative interference. Disappointment
was felt among the mass of the people, that the government
had taken care of itself, while their plans must be
impeded, and the labors of industry go unrewarded.</p>

<p><i>Issue of the Treasury Circular.</i>&mdash;This was a communication
from the secretary of the treasury to the several
collectors and receivers of the public money, containing
instructions in respect to the safe keeping of the same.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_705" id="Page_705">[Pg 705]</a></span>
The instructions were as follows: "Congress having adjourned
without making any additional provisions for the
security and safe keeping of the public money, it is obvious
that, in the present state of the laws and of the banks,
an unusual responsibility devolves upon those who collect
the revenues of the general government. The president
expects that exertions, corresponding to the occasion, will
cheerfully be made by every officer, and that no effort will
be spared to have all the laws, as well as the regulations
and instructions of the treasury department, scrupulously
enforced. Accuracy in your accounts, punctuality in your
returns, promptness in your deposites and payments, and
entire forbearance to use any part of the public funds for
private purposes, will, it is hoped, characterize the whole
class of collecting offices hereafter. In the present condition
of things, if any departure should unfortunately occur,
it will be much regretted; and, however unpleasant the
task, an exemplary and severe notice of the irregularity
will become necessary, in order to secure the great public
interests involved in this subject. The duty on the part of
public officers to abstain from the employment of the public
moneys for private advantage, is so apparent, that no excuse
whatever for it can be deemed admissible."</p>

<p><i>Continuance of the War in Florida.</i>&mdash;The war in
Florida continued to be prosecuted during the administration
of President Van Buren. Large sums of money
were expended in maintaining it. Three millions and a
half of dollars had been appropriated on its account, during
the years 1836 and 1837, under General Jackson; and at
the extra session in October, 1837, one million and six hundred
thousand dollars were appropriated; and in 1838, the
expenses for supporting the war in that quarter against the
Indians, amounted to as large a sum as in either of the two
preceding years. "When the difficulty arose with these
Indians, President Jackson supposed that it would be soon
terminated. And no one, at that time, had any reason to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_706" id="Page_706">[Pg 706]</a></span>
suppose it would continue for years, and have cost the government
eight or ten millions. Other measures than those
of force, would probably have terminated the difficulty at
an early period. It would certainly have saved many valuable
lives now lost to the country, and been far more satisfactory
to the friends of humanity throughout the Union."</p>

<p><i>Internal Improvements.</i>&mdash;During Mr. Van Buren's administration,
large sums were appropriated for internal improvements,
although the president was generally opposed to the
policy. The expenditures were, however, for purposes
which the advocates of state rights, for the most part,
believed to be legitimate, such as repairs on the Cumberland
road and its continuance through the states of
Indiana and Illinois; for light-houses, life-boats, buoys,
and monuments, in behalf of the interests of navigation.
In reference to these objects, there was always far more
agreement among the different parties in congress, than in
reference to any thing that seemed less essential to the
nation's benefit.</p>

<p><i>Public Expenses.</i>&mdash;The expenses of the government had
been increasing to a considerable extent, from year to year.
During the year 1837 and 1838, they amounted to nearly
thirty-two millions each. The number of public agents
was greatly multiplied, and the compensation for their
services was, in many cases, greatly increased. The
federal officers into whose hands moneys were placed, frequently
appropriated them for improper purposes, and thus
loss ensued. Extra services were often charged, through
some pretext, and thus the compensation allowed by law
was largely exceeded. The public printing for congress,
and for the departments under the executive, occasioned a
large and frequently a needless expenditure, as it was found,
in many cases, that the work could have been performed at
a far cheaper rate. Such was the tendency of high party
feeling towards an abuse of government patronage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_707" id="Page_707">[Pg 707]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Difficulties in the State of Maine.</i>&mdash;The North-eastern
boundary had long been a source of difficulty between the
United States and England. The question had seemed on
the eve of a decision by arms between the British authorities
in New Brunswick and the state of Maine. Armed
bands had been sent out on both sides to the territory in
dispute. General Scott had been sent to the scene of contention
by the president, and the affair, through the general's
exertions, was, for the time, quieted, yet not settled. The
danger attending this state of things, induced Mr. Van Buren,
on the 26th of February, 1839, to communicate to congress a
message on this subject, which resulted in an act of congress,
giving the president additional power for the defence of the
country, in certain cases, against invasion, or any attempt on
the part of Great Britain to exercise exclusive jurisdiction
over the disputed territory.</p>

<p>He was authorized, in this event, to accept the services
of any number of volunteers, not exceeding fifty thousand.
The sum of ten millions was appropriated for the president
to employ in executing the provisions of this act. At the
same time, an appropriation was made for the sending of a
special minister to England, should it be expedient in the
opinion of the president.</p>

<p><i>The Border Troubles on the Northern Frontier.</i>&mdash;The
Canada rebellion, so called, which broke out during the years
1837 and 1838, strongly enlisted the sympathies of many of
the Americans, especially in the northern parts of the states
of New York and Vermont. They viewed it as the sacred
cause of liberty and human rights. The consequence was,
that they assumed the name of <i>patriots</i>, and formed secret
associations, which they called Hunter's Lodges, with the
object of rendering assistance to the insurgents in their
efforts to establish independence in Canada.</p>

<p>"In the prosecution of this well-meant, but illegal interference
in the concerns of a foreign power, a daring party
of adventurers took possession of Navy island, a small spot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_708" id="Page_708">[Pg 708]</a></span>
of ground, containing about three hundred and fifty acres,
and situated in the Niagara river, about two miles above
the falls, and lying within the jurisdiction of Upper Canada.
It was fortified so strongly by the adventurers, as to resist
an attack upon it by Sir James Head, the commander of
the British forces. The president of the United States and
the governor of the state of New York both issued proclamations,
enjoining upon the inhabitants of the frontier to
observe a strict neutrality.</p>

<p>"Notwithstanding these injunctions, arms and ammunition
were procured, either by purchase or by stealth, and
kept for the use of the insurgents. The party upon Navy
island fired upon the opposite shore of Canada, and boats
were destroyed by the force of their shot. The persons
who were in possession of the island, amounting to seven
hundred, were fully supplied with provisions, and had collected
twenty pieces of cannon.</p>

<p>"These measures, on the part of the Americans, produced
great excitement among the provincial authorities in
Canada. A small steamboat, called the Caroline, was hired
by the insurgents, to ply between Navy Island and Schlosser,
on the American shore, in order to furnish the islanders
with the means of carrying on the war. It began to run
on the morning of the 29th of December, and, during the
evening of that day, a detachment of one hundred and
fifty armed men from the Canada side, in five boats, with
muffled oars, proceeded to Schlosser, drove the men who
were on board the Caroline ashore, cut her loose from her
fastenings to the wharf, and, setting the boat on fire, let her
float over the falls. In this enterprise, a man by the name
of Durfee was killed; and it is said that one or two more
were left in the steamboat when she went over the
cataract."<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>The Americans, in their turn, were greatly excited, and
the threatened serious consequences to the peace existing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_709" id="Page_709">[Pg 709]</a></span>
between our government and that of Great Britain, were,
with difficulty averted. The president, however, by proclamation
and other measures, succeeded, at length, in
checking the belligerent movements of our people on the
frontier.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Changes of Opinion among the People.</i>&mdash;Although the
president, during his visit to his native state in the summer
of 1839, for the first time since his inauguration, was every
where greeted with enthusiasm by his political friends, and
with great personal respect by his opponents, yet it was
evident that the political horizon wore a different aspect
from what it formerly had done. The derangement of the
currency and prostration of trade, attributed by many to
the mal-administration of government, had caused great
political changes. Of the representatives in the twenty-sixth
congress, there were one hundred and nineteen democrats
and one hundred and eighteen whigs, leaving out of
view five representatives from New Jersey, whose seats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_710" id="Page_710">[Pg 710]</a></span>
were contested. After several fierce debates, the democratic
members from this state were admitted.</p>

<p>Mr. Van Buren, in 1840, being a candidate for rëelection,
failed to carry the suffrages of the people. The great
political changes, from causes already intimated, as shown
in the state elections, gave, at the outset, but little hope of
his success.</p>

<p><i>Character of the Administration.</i>&mdash;Mr. Van Buren's
administration, which closed on the 3rd of March, 1841,
was an exciting one; and its character, even at this day,
cannot, in all respects, be properly estimated. The verdict
of posterity will be given with more justice than that of
the present generation, in respect to its real benefit to the
country. The great event of his administration, as has
been remarked, by which it "will hereafter be known and
designated, is the divorce of bank and state in the fiscal
affairs of the federal government, and the return, after half
a century of deviation, to the original design of the constitution."
The caution, however, which history must necessarily
observe on this subject, is well exhibited in the
following remarks:</p>

<p>"The full results of the peculiar and experimental policy
of President Jackson and President Van Buren, respecting
banks and the currency, in their influence on the condition
of the country, for good or for evil, for succeeding years,
cannot be correctly estimated. The immediate consequences
were a general disturbance of the trade and
monetary affairs of the nation, and an unprecedented check
to the accustomed pursuits of a people so enterprising
in their spirit, and so desirous of improving their condition,
as are the citizens of the United States. The sub-treasury
scheme also gave alarm to the friends of the constitution
generally, and to men of settled republican sentiments, who
perceived in it a deviation from the essential elements of
liberty recognized in the constitution, and a weakness of
the responsibility of public agents, who should always be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_711" id="Page_711">[Pg 711]</a></span>
controlled by the authority of law. They knew that
power was corrupting; that it was necessary to impose
checks on those who were clothed with political authority,
and to make them constantly amenable to their constituents.
The developments and effects of this fearful experiment,
must be left for narration to a distant day. The only just
hope of the perpetuity and future purity of the republic,
rest on the intelligence and virtue of the people, and on
their wisdom in the choice of men for places of public
trust; who, like Washington, shall make the constitution
their guide, and, under the controlling influence of its doctrines

<p><i>Canvass for the Presidency.</i>&mdash;Unusual efforts had been
put forth in the election of Mr. Van Buren's successor.
Never before had greater activity been manifested by the
leading political parties of the nation. The country had
been convulsed with the strife for many months. The whole
political press had exerted its utmost influences on the one
side or the other, and that, in many instances, in the most
unscrupulous manner. Considerations of great interest and
importance were urged by the respective parties; much
truth was uttered and widely disseminated, but more falsehood
and detraction. Popular meetings&mdash;in numbers, character,
and enthusiasm, never before assembled on the
American soil for this or any other purpose&mdash;were held
towards the conclusion of the political contest in every state,
and in almost every county. The most distinguished men
in the nation addressed thousands and tens of thousands, by
night and by day. Said an eminent statesman, on one occasion,
"If, on the occurrence of our presidential elections in
future, our contests must be so severe, so early begun, and
so long continued, human nature will fail. The energies
of man are not equal to the conflict." The question, which
had been actually determined before, was <i>officially</i> decided
on the 10th of February, 1841, when the ceremony of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_712" id="Page_712">[Pg 712]</a></span>
counting and announcing the votes of the electoral colleges
for president and vice-president took place. The result
was as follows:</p>

<p>The unwonted efforts put forth in the presidential canvass,
had prepared a majority of the people for an unusual
exultation of feeling on the accession of General Harrison;
but, in the providence of God, that exultation was destined
to be transitory. Just one month from the day of his inauguration,
after a brief sickness, he died. The nation, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_714" id="Page_714">[Pg 714]</a></span>
may well be believed, was surprised by this most unexpected
calamity. It was difficult to conceive that the
recent august spectacle of his introduction into the highest
office in the gift of his countrymen, should be so nearly
associated with his funeral honors. The loss seemed
severe, in proportion to the expectations that had been
indulged. A suitable commemoration of the distressing
event was observed throughout the United States, by
public bodies, and especially by Christian worshiping
assemblies. Political opponents, in many instances, were
not slow to render homage to the memory of the deceased
president. There had been time for no particular development
of principles or course of policy, on the part of the
administration. The cabinet had been formed, and things
were proceeding prosperously, and the future was full of
promises, when this bereavement came to quench the hopes
of millions.</p>

<p>This brief notice of a brief administration may be closed
by an extract from the circular issued by the members of
the cabinet, immediately after the president's decease, and
which alludes to his dying, as well as his living example:
"The people of the United States, overwhelmed, like ourselves,
by an event so unexpected and so melancholy, will
derive consolation from knowing that his death was calm
and resigned, as his life had been patriotic, useful, and distinguished;
and that the last utterance of his lips expressed
a firm desire for the perpetuity of the constitution,<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> and the
preservation of its true principles. In death, as in life, the
happiness of his country was uppermost in his thoughts."</p>

<p>Upon the demise of General Harrison, Mr. Tyler, the
vice-president, in accordance with the provisions of the

<p>The bereavement which the nation had experienced,
seemed to demand from it a solemn recognition of the
Divine Providence in the sad event. Accordingly, Mr.
Tyler very properly appointed a day of public humiliation,
fasting, and prayer, to be observed throughout the land, in
token of its sense of the Divine judgment, and, as a means
of securing the continuance of the Divine favor. This was
well received, and the day was religiously observed throughout
our widely-extended country.</p>

<p>In the room of an inaugural address, President Tyler
made an official declaration, in a published document, of
the principles and general course of policy which he
intended should mark his administration. These, as summarily
expressed, were generally satisfactory to his political
friends.</p>

administration will be noticed in the following order:</p>

<p><i>Extra Session of Congress.</i>&mdash;A few days before his
death, General Harrison had issued his proclamation for an
extra session of congress, to be held on the 31st of May,
1841, principally on account of the condition of the revenue
and finances of the country. These were suffering, in
consequence of the character of the events that had taken
place. The revenue was insufficient to support the government,
and the currency of the country was greatly
disordered. Congress assembled, in conformity to the proclamation,
and engaged in the grave and urgent business to
which their attention had been called.</p>

<p>Several important acts were passed at this session,
among which were&mdash;the <i>establishment of a uniform system
of bankruptcy</i>, a measure which seemed imperiously
required for the relief of more than half a million of debtors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_717" id="Page_717">[Pg 717]</a></span>
who otherwise had no prospect of paying their debts&mdash;a
bill providing for the <i>distribution of the net proceeds of
the public lands among the states</i>, according to their
respective population on the federal representative scale&mdash;also,
the <i>repeal of the sub-treasury law</i>, which had been
adopted towards the close of Mr. Van Buren's administration&mdash;and
an act <i>imposing duties of twenty per cent. on the
value of all articles of import not expressly excepted therein</i>.</p>

<p>Congress, at this time, passed a bill having in view the
establishment of a national bank, which, however, Mr.
Tyler saw fit to veto, notwithstanding, in his first message,
he had recommended a bank of some kind. The bill,
which the president set aside, chiefly, as he alleged, from
his doubts as to its accordance with the constitution, contained,
in the view of its framers, a compromise sufficient
to overcome his constitutional objections to a bank. But
having, in his veto-message, shadowed forth a fiscal agent,
such as was believed he might approve, a bill, in agreement
therewith, was framed and adopted; yet this also he vetoed;
and there not being a constitutional majority in its favor, it
was lost. This was a result, in both cases, sufficiently
mortifying to the political party which had raised him
to power. To the friends of a national bank, the disappointment
was extreme. Great excitement prevailed,
and all of Mr. Tyler's cabinet, except Mr. Webster,
resigned.</p>

<p><i>Relations with Great Britain.</i>&mdash;A communication was
made to the American government, on the part of that
of Great Britain, as announced by the president in his
message of the 6th of December, 1841, respecting the
destruction of the steamboat Caroline. That affair, it was
alleged, was undertaken by orders from the authorities of
the British government. Under this sanction, the release
of Alexander McLeod, a British subject, who had been
indicted for the murder of an American citizen, on that
occasion, was demanded by the English authorities. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_718" id="Page_718">[Pg 718]</a></span>
happened, however, favorably for the peace of the two
countries, that McLeod had previously been tried in the
state of New York, and acquitted. The excitement and
anxiety, among all parties, had been intense during the
trial, and the result was awaited, with no little foreboding,
on the part of the peaceably disposed. It was now only
left that the affair of the Caroline should, in some way, be
adjusted by negotiation.</p>

<p><i>Settlement of the North-eastern Boundary.</i>&mdash;The important
event of defining and agreeing upon the North-eastern
boundary of the United States, took place in 1842. The
treaty made with England on this subject, was ratified by
the senate on the 20th of August, of that year. The
proper boundary, between the United States and the
British possessions in that quarter, had long been a matter
of serious controversy and difficulty. The claims of either
country conflicted with those of the other&mdash;bitter feelings
were engendered among the inhabitants dwelling on the
borders, and disturbances not unfrequently took place
between them, so that the peaceful relations of the two
powers were, to some extent, constantly endangered. It
was fortunate for the country, that Mr. Webster was still a
member of the cabinet, and brought the weight of his character
and official station to bear upon this question. It was
also fortunate for England that she sent so conciliating and
able a negotiator as Lord Ashburton, to treat on the subject.
In the spirit of kindness and compromise, the matter
was discussed, and, at length, settled between them&mdash;the
president, at the same time cöoperating in endeavors to the
same effect.</p>

<p>That the states of Maine and Massachusetts, who were
interested in the division to be made between the countries,
might be satisfied, their respective legislatures appointed
several gentlemen as commissioners on the occasion. The
treaty was duly ratified on the part of both powers, in the latter
part of 1842, with the public proclamation of the same by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_719" id="Page_719">[Pg 719]</a></span>
the president; and thus ended a harassing controversy of
fifty years' standing.</p>

<p><i>Difficulties in Rhode Island.</i>&mdash;From a state of things
which existed in Rhode Island at this time (1842), the
most serious consequences were feared, in respect to that
commonwealth, if not to the Union at large. In attempts
to set aside the ancient charter of the state, the mode of
adopting a new constitution became a matter of controversy
among the people. A portion of them proceeded, in
a manner unauthorized by the laws of the state, in erecting
the fabric of the government. This portion of the citizens,
called the "suffrage party," actually formed and adopted a
constitution of their own, made choice of Thomas W.
Dorr as governor, and elected a legislature. This was
aside from the government which was already existing in
the state. That being administered regularly at the same
time, and another portion of the citizens, called the "law
and order party," upholding it; a conflict, as to authority,
necessarily ensued between the two parties. The law and
order party had chosen their governor, Samuel W. King,
at the appointed period, and both parties met to transact
the business usually attended to at the meeting of legislative
bodies.</p>

<p>"The legally organized party then took active measures
to put down what was denominated the rebellion. Great
commotion ensued, and several arrests were made. Dorr
left the state, but soon returning, his followers assembled
under arms, and a bloody struggle appeared inevitable.
The insurgents, however, dispersed on the appearance of
the government forces, and Dorr, to avoid arrest, fled
from the state.</p>

<p>"In June, however, the insurgents again made their
appearance under arms, and were joined by Dorr. The
whole state was now placed under martial law, and a large
body of armed men was sent against the insurgents, who
dispersed without any effectual resistance. Dorr again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_720" id="Page_720">[Pg 720]</a></span>
fled; but returning, after a few months, was arrested, tried
for treason, convicted, and sentenced to be imprisoned
during life. In the mean time, a constitution for the state
had been adopted, according to the prescribed forms of
law. In June, 1845, Dorr was released, although he had
refused to accept a pardon on condition of taking the oath
of allegiance to the state government."</p>

<p><i>Modification of the Tariff.</i>&mdash;A well-regulated tariff was
believed, by many, to be the only measure by which the
financial disorders and stagnation in business, so characteristic
of the times, could be remedied. Accordingly, before
the adjournment of the second session of the twenty-seventh
congress (August 31st, 1842), a bill modifying, in some
important particulars, the existing tariff, passed both houses
of congress, and received the signature of the president.
The first bill introduced and passed, was vetoed by Mr.
Tyler; and, for a time, the friends of the measure indulged
in painful apprehensions as to the final issue. An unwonted
hostility had been manifested, on the part of a powerful
party, to any modification of the law on this subject, and
every step of its progress had been most earnestly and
bitterly contested. But the imperious necessity of the
measure, the wants of the national treasury, and the suffering
condition of the various branches of industry, induced
congress to yield to the prejudices of the executive.
Accordingly, such alterations were made in the bill vetoed
as comported with the president's views, and it was returned
with his signature.</p>

<p><i>Celebration of the Bunker's hill Monument.</i>&mdash;"In June,
1843, was celebrated, with great pomp and appropriate
ceremonies, the completion of the Bunker's hill monument.
This great public work had met with numerous delays;
but, having at length received its topmost stone, the 17th
of June, the anniversary of the battle, was assigned to celebrate
the event. The president and several members of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_721" id="Page_721">[Pg 721]</a></span>
his cabinet honored the celebration. A multitude, of all
classes, and from various parts of the country, were present.
An oration was pronounced by Mr. Webster on the occasion.
The pageant was grand and imposing, and calculated
to exalt, in the hearts of assembled thousands, the
virtues and patriotism of the men who had, in by-gone
years, moistened the soil on which the monument stands
with their richest blood. A sad event, however, followed
fast upon the festivities of the day&mdash;this was the sudden
decease of Mr. Legare, the recently-appointed secretary
of state. He had followed the president to witness the
celebration; but sudden sickness fell upon him, and he
died at his lodgings, in Boston, on the morning after the
celebration."</p>

<p><i>Treaties.</i>&mdash;The treaty with <i>Great Britain</i>, fixing a boundary
line between the United States and Canada, has already
been elsewhere mentioned. But in addition to that subject,
the treaty at that time formed also stipulated, that each
nation should maintain on the coast of Africa a naval force,
of vessels sufficient to carry, in all, not less than eighty guns;
to be independent of each other, but to act in concert for
the suppression of the slave trade. By another article of
the treaty, it was stipulated that fugitives from justice, found
in either country, should be delivered up by the two governments
respectively, upon complaint, and upon what
should be deemed sufficient evidence to sustain the charge.</p>

<p>A treaty between the United States and the <i>Chinese
Empire</i>, was ratified by a unanimous vote of the senate,
during the second session of the twenty-eighth congress.
The treaty was concluded by Caleb Cushing and Tsying,
on the 3d of July, 1844. It placed our relations with China
on a new footing, and under auspices highly favorable to
the commerce and other interests of this country.</p>

<p>Some months previous to this time, a treaty had been
negotiated with <i>Texas</i>, respecting the annexation of that
republic, as a territory, to the United States. The annunciation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_722" id="Page_722">[Pg 722]</a></span>
of such a treaty, was made to congress in April,
1844, by a special message from the president, and excited
much surprise throughout the country, and awakened great
anxiety in the minds of those who were opposed to the
measure. They viewed it as involving an extension of
slavery, and a probable war with Mexico, as she still laid
claim to Texas as a portion of her rightful domain. The
senate, however, rejected the treaty, and thus frustrated
Mr. Tyler's designs at that period.</p>

<p><i>Joint Resolution for the Annexation of Texas.</i>&mdash;The
rejection of the treaty with Texas, before mentioned,
seemed not to discourage the president from attempting
the annexation of that country to the United States, in violation,
as many believed, of the constitution. According to
his wishes, and it is supposed at his suggestion, a joint resolution<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
for annexation was introduced into congress, and
passed the house of representatives, January 23d, 1845, by
a vote of one hundred and eighteen to one hundred and one.
In the senate, the resolution underwent several important
amendments, particularly one by Mr. Walker, involving
the alternative of negotiation at the option of the president,
which, having been concurred in by the house, received the
sanction of the executive, and thus the way was prepared
for the annexation of the country in question.</p>

<p>"As these measures, in regard to the admission of Texas,
were adopted at the close of the session of congress, it was
expected that Mr. Tyler would leave it to his successor to
consummate the wishes of congress, and it was also understood
that Mr. Polk had determined to negotiate a treaty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_723" id="Page_723">[Pg 723]</a></span>
with Texas, under the alternative offered by Mr. Walker's
amendment. President Tyler, however, determined to
forestall the action of his successor, and hence dispatched
an express to communicate to Texas, that he had decided
to invite Texas into the Union, under the provisions of the
resolutions as they passed the house of representatives,
without the exercise of farther treaty-making power."</p>

<p><i>Character of Mr. Tyler's Administration.</i>&mdash;"Of the
character of Mr. Tyler's administration, and his personal
relations thereto, it is yet too early to speak. His independent
course in vetoing the bank bills and other measures,
greatly exasperated the party who had elevated him to
office, and he was denounced as a traitor; while his equally
independent course in opposing General Jackson in his
measures against the United States' bank, and also his alliance
with the whigs during Mr. Van Buren's administration,
denied him the confidence of the democrats. He himself
said, 'I appeal from the vituperation of the present day to
the pen of impartial history, in the full confidence that
neither my motives nor my acts will bear the interpretation
which has, for sinister purposes, been placed upon them.'
As an executive of the people's will, he exhibited all the
necessary vigor of a chief magistrate. 'Nor is it to be
denied,' says one of his political opponents, 'that the foreign
relations of the United States were ably managed during
his presidential term, and that he generally surrounded himself
with able counsellors in his cabinet.'"</p>

<p><i>Presidential Canvass.</i>&mdash;Mr. Tyler's presidential term
expired on the 4th of March, 1845, and he was not rëelected,
nor indeed was he a candidate for rëelection, except for a
short period. The candidates of the two great political
parties were now Henry Clay, of Kentucky, and James K.
Polk, of Tennessee. These had been nominated by the
respective conventions of the parties, which had assembled
in the city of Baltimore, one on the 1st, and the other on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_724" id="Page_724">[Pg 724]</a></span>
the 17th of May, 1844. The strife and the efforts of the
adherents of the respective candidates were eager and
persevering. The issue, for some time, appeared to be
doubtful; but the close of the canvass showed that the
democratic nominee had been elected.</p>

<p>The election of Mr. Polk to the presidency was not very
strongly anticipated by the democratic party; for besides
the great popularity of his rival, Mr. Clay, he had received
the nomination of the Baltimore Convention, held in May<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_726" id="Page_726">[Pg 726]</a></span>
of the previous year, not as the first choice of that body,
but because of its inability to harmonize on another candidate.
Before the meeting of the convention, Mr. Van Buren
was expected to be the prominent candidate; but his avowed
opposition to the annexation of Texas, added to other sources
of dissatisfaction, induced the convention to abandon him,
and to select a candidate in the person of James K. Polk,
whose political views were supposed to be more in accordance
with those of the democratic party, especially at the
South. During the first seven ballotings of the convention,
Mr. Polk did not receive a single vote; on the eighth balloting,
but forty-four; while on the ninth, he received every
vote of the convention, amounting to two hundred and
sixty-six in number. On the occurrence of the election,
despite the efforts which were made in favor of the whig
candidate, he was elected by a strong majority.</p>

<p>On the occasion of his induction into office, Mr. Polk,
following usage, delivered an address, explanatory of the
principles which would guide him in the administration of
the government. These were so nearly identical with those
expressed by his predecessors, that we deem it unnecessary
to detail them. It may be stated, however, that he expressed
himself opposed to a national bank&mdash;to a tariff for protection
only; but was strongly in favor of the annexation of Texas,
and was satisfied of our "clear and unquestionable title to
Oregon." In official action, he pledged himself to administer
the government for the whole people, irrespective of the
party by which he was elected.</p>

<p>The events and measures which signalized the administration
of Mr. Polk were&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Decease of General Jackson.</i>&mdash;A short time previous
to the termination of his presidential career, General Jackson
was attacked with a severe hemorrhage of the lungs.
He recovered, however, sufficiently to be present at the
inauguration of his successor. On his arrival at the Hermitage,
he was weak and infirm; but relaxation from
arduous duties, added to the attention of friends, at length
restored him to comparative health. His lungs, however,
were from this time feeble, if not positively diseased.</p>

<p>But, for several months prior to his decease, his health
became visibly worse. He was constantly cheered, however,
by the visits of his old and attached personal friends;
and the consolations of religion were a never-failing solace
to his heart.</p>

<p>"General Jackson continued to grow more feeble until
the 8th day of June, 1845. Early in the morning of that
day he swooned, and, for some time, was supposed to be
dead. On reviving from the swoon, he became conscious
that the spark of life was nearly extinguished, and, expecting
to die before another sun would set, he sent for his
family and connections to come and receive his dying
benediction. His remarks, it is said, were full of affection
and Christian resignation. His mind retained its vigor to
the last, and his dying moments, even more than his earlier
years, exhibited its highest intellectual light. His death
took place on the evening of the 8th of June, in the seventy-ninth
year of his age. By his request, Dr. Edgar, of the
Presbyterian church, preached his funeral sermon."<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>General Jackson was, doubtless, no ordinary man. For
many years, he occupied a prominent place in the affairs
of his country. Whatever may have been thought of the
wisdom or constitutionality of some of his measures, all
united in awarding to him the merit of honesty, and a true
desire to promote the welfare of the nation. That he was
ardent, sometimes rash, and withal precipitate in his measures,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_728" id="Page_728">[Pg 728]</a></span>
and then determined, may be admitted, without any
meditated wrong to his reputation. But when death laid
him in the grave, political differences were forgotten, and
political opponents united in paying a high and well-merited
tribute to his memory.</p>

<p><i>Admission of Texas.</i>&mdash;We have already had occasion to
refer (p. <a href="#Page_721">721</a>) to the joint-resolution of congress, of the
23d of January, 1845, for the annexation of Texas to the
United States. The conditions prescribed by that resolution
were subsequently accepted by Texas, and, in his
first annual message to congress, Mr. Polk informed that
body that nothing remained to consummate that annexation
but the passage of an act by congress, admitting her into
the Union upon an equal footing with the original states.</p>

<p>To such a strange and summary process of admitting
states, there were loud and strong remonstrances. The
unconstitutionality of the measure was urged; but more, the
probable increased disturbance of our relations with Mexico,
which still claimed the jurisdiction, whether justly or
not, over a considerable part of the territory. Besides, it
was contended that the direct effect would be to extend the
oppressions and curses of slavery.</p>

<p>Neither argument nor remonstrance, however, served to
induce the president or his supporters to pause. They
pretended to foresee great and signal blessings as the
necessary result of thus extending the free institutions of
the United States. And, accordingly, it was, upon the
recommendation of the president, resolved by congress to
admit Texas upon an equal footing with the original states.
And the grant was made to her, which had not before been
made since the adoption of the federal constitution, to
allow her two representatives, while her population was
insufficient to entitle her to one, except under the specific
provision of the constitution, that each state shall have, at
least, one representative.</p>

<p>In consequence of these measures, in relation to Texas,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_729" id="Page_729">[Pg 729]</a></span>
by the American government, and at an early stage of
them, the Mexican minister demanded his passports; and,
at a subsequent date, the American minister, Mr. Slidell,
was refused a reception and recognition, as such, by the
Mexican government. Thus, as had been predicted by the
opposers of annexation, a serious misunderstanding, which
already existed between the United States and Mexico, in
relation to the conduct of the latter touching other matters,
was rendered still more serious, and was rapidly tending,
it was plainly perceptible, to open hostilities between the
two powers.</p>

<p>While such was the position of our relations with Mexico&mdash;the
horizon becoming daily more obscure, and clouds,
portentous of evil, were rising higher and higher&mdash;a single
act of the president precipitated the war which many had
predicted, but which all saw reason to deplore. This was
an order issued to General Taylor to break up his encampment
at Corpus Christi, and, passing the Neuces, to concentrate
his forces on the left bank of the Rio del Norte.</p>

<p><i>Division of Oregon.</i>&mdash;Prior to the introduction of Mr.
Polk into office, several attempts had been made by the
governments of the United States and Great Britain to
settle, by negotiations, questions in dispute between them,
as to the proprietorship and occupation of Oregon&mdash;all of
which had failed. These negotiations were conducted at
London, in the years 1818, 1824, and 1826; the first two,
under the administration of Mr. Monroe; the last, under
that of Mr. Adams. The negotiations of 1818 having
failed to accomplish its object, it was agreed, October 20th
of that year, that, to the citizens of each nation, the harbors,
bays, &amp;c., should be open for ten years. The negotiations
of 1824, left this agreement untouched, as did those
of 1826; but, August 6th, 1827, it was further agreed, that
it should be competent for either party, after October 20th,
1828, to annul this convention, by giving to the other
twelve months' notice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_730" id="Page_730">[Pg 730]</a></span></p>

<p>Subsequently, negotiations were resumed. In 1844, the
British plenipotentiaries offered to divide the Oregon territory
by the forty-ninth parallel of latitude, leaving the
navigation of Columbia river free to both nations. This
proposition was immediately rejected by the American
minister; whereupon, he was invited by the British minister
to make a proposition in return.</p>

<p>At this stage of the negotiation, Mr. Polk took the presidential
chair; and, anxious to settle the question, he made
the same offer which had been made by the British minister,
excepting the free navigation of the Columbia river.
This proposition being unacceptable, further negotiations
terminated.</p>

<p>On the meeting of congress, in December, 1845, the
president recommended that the notice required by the
convention of August, 1827, should be given to Great
Britain, which, at the expiration of a year, would bring the
question to an issue. The subject, thus brought to the
notice of congress, excited the highest possible interest.
The friends of the executive, and perhaps others, were
strongly in favor of giving the required notice, while
serious apprehensions were entertained by many, that the
<i>practical</i> effect of such a measure would be a war between
the two nations. At length, the question was settled by the
adoption of a resolution in accordance with the executive
recommendation. In the house, the vote on the resolution
was one hundred and forty-two to forty-six; in the senate,
forty-two to ten.</p>

<p>The official notice, thus directed, was given by the president
to her majesty Queen Victoria, on the 28th of April,
1846. Before the delivery of this notice, however, the
British minister at Washington had received instructions
to submit to the American government a new and further
proposition for a partition of the territory in dispute.</p>

<p>In a special and confidential communication to the senate
on the 10th of June, the president informed congress that
such a proposition had been made, and requested their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_731" id="Page_731">[Pg 731]</a></span>
advice. At the same time, he reiterated the views
expressed in his annual message, that no compromise,
which the United States ought to accept, could be effected;
that our title to the whole of Oregon was maintained by
irrefragable arguments, and that the claim could not be
abandoned, without a sacrifice of both national honor and
interests. Such was the tenor of the president's communication.
But he solicited advice. In a resolution, adopted
thirty-eight to twelve, the senate advised the president to
accept the proposal of the British government, which he
accordingly did; and, on the 16th of June, a convention or
treaty, settling boundaries, &amp;c., in relation to Oregon, was
communicated by the president to the senate, by the latter
of which it was ratified, forty-one to fourteen.</p>

<p>The amicable settlement of such a question, which had
long subsisted between the two governments&mdash;which had
employed, time after time, and for a series of years, some
of the most distinguished statesmen on both sides the water&mdash;which
had given birth to warm and excited feelings, and
to warm and contentious words&mdash;which had become more
embarrassing the longer negotiations were continued, and
which, it was agreed on both sides, was fast ripening into
open rupture and collision&mdash;the amicable settlement of such
a question, was a subject worthy of congratulation in both
hemispheres. If the terms of the treaty were not so favorable
to the American nation as might have been obtained,
they were such as the friends of peace and good understanding
were willing to accept; and, as it was admitted
that the treaty was consummated through the wisdom and
firmness of the senate, that body received, as it was entitled
to receive, the thanks of the nation.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Mexican War.</i>&mdash;In compliance with the order of the
president, already noticed (p. <a href="#Page_729">729</a>), General Taylor arrived,
with the "army of occupation," on the 28th of March,
before Matamoras. On the same day, the Mexican general,
Ampudia, warned General Taylor to withdraw his forces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_732" id="Page_732">[Pg 732]</a></span>
beyond the Nueces, which notification was repeated by
General Arista, on the 24th of April, who, at that date,
superseded Ampudia. On the same day, a rumor prevailed
that the enemy were crossing the river, above and
below the American camp. To ascertain the truth of this
rumor, Captain Ker, with a squadron of dragoons, was
directed to reconnoitre between the camp and the mouth
of the river; while another squadron, consisting of sixty-three
dragoons, under Captain Thornton, was sent above
for the same object. The former returned without having
seen or heard of a hostile corps. But the party under
Captain Thornton was suddenly surrounded by a large
body of Mexican infantry and cavalry, made prisoners, and
taken to Matamoras. Captain Thornton himself effected
an escape by an extraordinary leap of his horse, which,
however, subsequently fell with and injured him. In
endeavoring to return to the camp, he was taken a few
miles from it, and joined his men, as a prisoner, at Matamoras.
This was the first actual fight of the war, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_733" id="Page_733">[Pg 733]</a></span>
was the occasion of great exultation on the part of the
Mexicans.</p>

<p><i>Siege of Fort Brown.</i>&mdash;While these events were transpiring,
intelligence was received by General Taylor that
Point Isabel, the harbor on the Texas coast nearest the
mouth of the Rio Grande, and where all his military stores
were deposited, was about being assailed, and that all
communication with that important post might soon be
interrupted. This intelligence decided General Taylor at
once to take up his line of march for the Point, and to open
a communication between that and Fort Brown. Arrangements
were accordingly made. Fort Brown was so nearly
completed, that under a competent garrison it might prudently
be left. Major Jacob Brown, after whom the fort
was named, was put in command of it, and the seventh
regiment of infantry and two companies of artillery were
assigned as the garrison.</p>

<p>These arrangements having been completed, General
Taylor, with the main body of the army, commenced his
march towards Point Isabel. It was a hazardous, but
necessary movement. Of the number, position, and plans
of the enemy he was profoundly ignorant. The Mexican
General, Arista, mistook this movement of General Taylor
towards Point Isabel for a precipitate retreat, and immediately
dispatched a courier extraordinary to Mexico,
announcing the fact. In the opinion of some, he was better
informed, but "wished, for ulterior purposes, to create such
an impression among the Mexican soldiers and the Mexican
government." But whatever might have been his ignorance,
he soon had an opportunity to inform himself of the
real object of the movement, and therefore set about
endeavoring to destroy Fort Brown.</p>

<p>For two days following the departure of the army, Fort
Brown remained unmolested; but, on the third morning, the
Mexicans opened upon it with a battery of seven guns,
killing Sergeant Weigard, but otherwise effecting no material<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_734" id="Page_734">[Pg 734]</a></span>
injury. On leaving the fort, General Taylor had
instructed Major Brown, in case the Mexicans surrounded
it, to give him information by firing the eighteen-pounders
at stated intervals. The contingency having occurred, the
critical condition of the fort was thus communicated to
General Taylor, who made instant preparations to return
to its relief. Meanwhile, the bombardment was renewed;
during which, Major Brown was mortally wounded, and
was succeeded in command by Captain Hawkins.</p>

<p>On the 7th and 8th, the bombardment was continued; but
about two o'clock it ceased, when was heard, in the direction
of Point Isabel, a heavy cannonading. It was the
presage of relief, as Captain Hawkins inferred from it that,
in whatever contest General Taylor was engaged, he was
urging his return. And so it proved. Towards the close
of the day, intelligence was received that the Americans
had "met the enemy," and had driven them back towards
Matamoras.</p>

<p><i>Battle of Palo Alto.</i>&mdash;General Taylor had heard the signal-guns
at Fort Brown; and, on the evening of the 7th, left
Point Isabel with a force of about two thousand one hundred
men, with a large train of provisions and military stores.
At the distance of seven miles, he encamped, resuming his
march early on the morning of the 8th. In their progress,
they at length reached a broad prairie, bounded by Palo
Alto, a thick grove of dwarfish trees. On either side of
the American army were ponds of water, and beyond
them, chapparal. Upon this prairie, a large body of Mexicans
were drawn up in battle array. No time was lost in
the requisite preparations, on the part of the Americans,
and soon a cannonading was commenced on either side,
which for two hours rent the air with its thunders. In the
firing of the Mexicans there was little precision, their missiles
almost invariably passing over the American lines,
while the discharges from the American guns marked their
courses with carnage and death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_735" id="Page_735">[Pg 735]</a></span></p>

<p>At the expiration of two hours, the Mexican batteries
began to slacken, and, at length, ceased altogether. They
were unable longer to withstand the terrible and destructive
fire of Ringgold's, Churchill's, Duncan's, and Ridgeley's
guns, and began to fall back, for the purpose of forming a
new line of battle under cover of the smoke. The Americans
also formed a new line. At the expiration of an
hour, the action was renewed by our artillery, which was
even more destructive than before. As night was now
drawing on, the Mexicans, bent on one last and most vigorous
effort, poured in upon Ringgold's battery a literal
tempest of balls. Captain Page fell, mortally wounded, a
cannon-ball having carried away the whole of his lower-jaw;
and the brave Ringgold, nearly at the same time, had
both legs shot away by a cannon-ball, which passed through
his horse. On the 11th, he died at Point Isabel.</p>

<p>With great spirit and determination did Arista and his
army maintain the contest; but it was in vain. They
were at length driven from the field in hopeless disorder.
Night put an end to the contest; and the wearied and
exhausted victors sank upon the field, where they chanced
to be, glad to find opportunity to rest from toil so severe.
The force of General Taylor did not exceed two thousand
three hundred; that of Arista consisted of six thousand
infantry, with seven pieces of artillery, and eight hundred
cavalry. The loss of the Americans was but four men
killed&mdash;three officers&mdash;and thirty-seven wounded. Two
hundred Mexicans were killed; four hundred wounded.
Some estimate their loss in killed, wounded, and missing,
little short of one thousand.</p>

   <img src="images/illus-739.jpg" alt="Charge of Captain May." title="Charge of Captain May."/>
   <p class="caption2">Charge of Captain May.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Resaca de la Palma.</i>&mdash;At two o'clock, on the following
day, the American army moved from the field of victory,
at Palo Alto, towards Fort Brown. Towards evening,
what was their surprise when, on approaching a ravine,
called Resaca de la Palma, or the Dry River of Palma, they
discovered the Mexican army occupying this exceedingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_736" id="Page_736">[Pg 736]</a></span>
well-selected spot, and drawn up in battle array. A vigorous
action immediately ensued. The Mexican artillery
became engaged with Ridgeley's battery, as the latter
moved up the ravine. Generals La Vega and Requena
superintended the former, and the effect of the firing soon
began to be severely felt along the American lines. To
dislodge them, became indispensable to the safety of the
Americans. The execution of this duty was assigned to
Captain May, whose celebrated charge now took place.
"I will do it," said May; and, turning to his troops, he rose
in his stirrups, pointed to the guns before them, now pouring
forth their terrific explosions, and exclaimed, "Remember
your regiment! men, follow!" He struck his charger,
and bounded on before them, while a deafening cheer
answered his call; and immediately the whole were dashing
towards the cannons' mouths. May outstripped them&mdash;fortunately,
wonderfully did he escape, and wonderful was
it that so many of his squadron escaped, exposed, as they
were, to a fire which swept fearfully along the very line<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_737" id="Page_737">[Pg 737]</a></span>
they were pursuing. Some, indeed, there met an untimely
fate&mdash;seven men, among whom were the brave and noble-hearted
Inge and Sacket. Terrific as was the scene, May
and his followers pressed on. As they approached the
battery, at a single bound, May's horse cleared it. The
horses of a few others were equal to the leap, and their
impetus carried them beyond the guns. Wheeling again,
they drove the gunners off, and Captain Graham, and
Lieutenants Pleasantson and Winship, with others, coming
up, were masters of the battery. General La Vega was
made prisoner. The American infantry now charged the
Mexican line; for a time, the latter fought desperately, and
sustained themselves with stubborn bravery; but, at length,
yielding to necessity, they precipitately fled from the field.
In this battle, only the outlines of which we give, the
Americans captured eight pieces of artillery, several standards,
large military stores, and several hundred prisoners.
The loss of the Americans, in both these actions, was
three officers and forty men killed. Besides the officers
already named, was Lieutenant Cochrane. Thirteen officers
and one hundred men were wounded. The Mexican loss
was one hundred and fifty-four officers and men killed;
two hundred and five wounded; missing, one hundred and
fifty-six. General Taylor, following the battle, continued
his march to Fort Brown; and, on the 18th, took possession
of Matamoras, the Mexican settlement opposite.</p>

<p><i>Fall of Monterey.</i>&mdash;Following the occupation of Matamoras,
preparations were made, by order of the government,
for an advance into the interior of Mexico. During
these preparations, which occupied the space of three
months, several Mexican villages, Reinosa, Wier, Revilla,
and Camargo, were taken possession of. This last place,
situated about one hundred and eighty miles above the
mouth of the Rio Grande, was selected as a <i>dépôt</i> of supplies;
and to this point, the several divisions of General
Taylor's army were at length concentrated. The first of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_738" id="Page_738">[Pg 738]</a></span>
these divisions, two thousand and eighty, was commanded
by General Twiggs; the second, one thousand seven hundred
and eighty, by General Worth; the third, two thousand
eight hundred and ten, by General Butler.</p>

<p>On the 19th of September, these several divisions reached
a place called Walnut Springs, distant from Monterey
three miles. The capture of this city was now the immediate
object in view. It was a strongly-fortified place, with
a competent garrison under command of General Ampudia.
On the evening of the 19th, a reconnoisance of the fortifications
was made; and, on the following day, the attack
was commenced by the division of General Worth. On
the 21st, the attack was renewed, and two fortified
heights were taken; the guns of one of which was turned
upon the bishop's palace, which had been rendered exceedingly
strong. On the 22d, other heights, above the bishop's
palace, were carried, and, soon after, the palace itself. As
these fortifications, in a measure, commanded the city, the
enemy, on the night of the 22d, evacuated all his defences
in the lower part. On the morning of the 23d, the streets
of the upper part of the city became the scene of action.
Here the battle raged. All that day the firing was kept
up; the American troops proceeded from house to house&mdash;from
square to square&mdash;the Mexicans resisting them at
every step. The carnage was frightful.</p>

<p>Early on the 24th, Ampudia prepared to evacuate the
town; a suspension of hostilities was, therefore, arranged
till twelve o'clock; during which, at the request of Ampudia,
General Taylor had an interview with him, which
resulted in a capitulation; placing the town and materials
of war, with certain exceptions, in the possession of the
American general.</p>

<p>The city was found to be of great strength. There
were mounted forty-two pieces of cannon. The Mexican
force consisted of seven thousand troops of the line and
two or three thousand irregulars. The American force
was four hundred and twenty-five officers, and six thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_739" id="Page_739">[Pg 739]</a></span>
two hundred and twenty men. The artillery was one ten-inch
mortar, two twenty-four pound howitzers, and four
light field batteries, of four guns each.</p>

<p>The American loss was twelve officers and one hundred
and eight men killed; thirty-one officers and three hundred
and thirty-seven men wounded. The loss of the Mexicans
was still more considerable. An armistice was allowed by
General Taylor, of eight weeks, subject to be revoked by
either government. On receiving intelligence of the armistice
and its conditions, the American government, it is said,
directed its termination. The Mexican army was permitted
to retire, and marched out with the honors of war.</p>

<p><i>Victory at Buena Vista.</i>&mdash;For some months following the
occupation of Monterey, General Taylor was variously
employed; during which time, with what he had already
achieved, the conquest of the provinces of New Mexico,
New Leon, Coahuila, and Tamaulipas, in the Mexican
republic, had been effected.</p>

<p>As an advance still farther into the interior of Mexico
was ordered by the government, General Worth, with his
division, had some time previously been sent forward to
take the pass at Saltillo, fifty miles west of Monterey. To
this point, leaving a force of one thousand five hundred
men to garrison Monterey, General Taylor directed his
course on the 31st of January, and, on the 2d of February,
reached Saltillo. His effective force at this time was about
five thousand. On the 4th of February, he advanced
upon Agua Nueva, a strong position on the road leading
from Saltillo to San Luis; at which place intelligence
was received, on the 21st, that Santa Anna, the Mexican
general-in-chief, with an army exceeding twenty thousand
men, was on the advance. Finding his present position, at
Agua Nueva, less favorable for a conflict with a force so
overwhelming, he fell back upon Buena Vista, a strong
mountain-pass, eleven miles nearer Saltillo. Of the five
thousand troops, of which his army was composed, less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_740" id="Page_740">[Pg 740]</a></span>
than five hundred were regulars; while, on the other hand,
the army of Santa Anna consisted of the flower of the
Mexican nation. The odds were fearful, being more than
four to one.</p>

<p>At length, on the 22d of February, the Mexican army
bore down upon General Taylor, whose troops, now formed
in order of battle, calmly awaited the approach of the Mexican
host. Halting his army at some little distance, Santa
Anna sent a summons to General Taylor to surrender; to
which the hero of Palo Alto very politely, but laconically
replied, "I beg leave to say, that I decline acceding to your
request."</p>

<p>Still, the enemy forbore, for a time, an attack, evidently
waiting the arrival of his rear columns. But on the morning
of the 23d, the conflict between the armies began. A
full description of the battle would occupy pages. Few
engagements were ever entered upon when the forces were
so unequal in numbers. That victory should declare for
Taylor and his five thousand troops, is the wonder and
admiration of all military men. But while all due praise
is accorded to the infantry and the few cavalry engaged,
the most effectual work was accomplished by the artillery.
The American artillery cannot probably be excelled. At
one moment&mdash;a most critical and anxious moment it was&mdash;when
it seemed nearly impossible but that the Mexican
army should overpower&mdash;if by no other means, by the
force of numbers&mdash;Captain Bragg was ordered to take a
particular position with his battery, the Mexican line being
but a few yards from the muzzle of his pieces. The first
discharge of the cannister caused the enemy&mdash;probably
advancing as they were&mdash;to pause and hesitate; while a
second and third discharge drove them back in disorder;
and, in the words of General Taylor, "saved the day."</p>

<p>That night&mdash;it was a night intensely cold&mdash;the American
soldiers were compelled to bivouac without fires, expecting
that the morning would renew the conflict. During the
night, the wounded were removed to Saltillo. The following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_741" id="Page_741">[Pg 741]</a></span>
day, prisoners were exchanged, the dead were collected
and buried; and it may be added, that the Mexican wounded,
left upon the field by Santa Anna, were sent to Saltillo, and
comfortably provided for.</p>

<p>The loss of the Americans during the action was, killed,
two hundred and sixty-seven; wounded, four hundred and
fifty-six; missing, twenty-three. The Mexican loss in killed
and wounded was supposed to amount to two thousand&mdash;five
hundred of whom were left upon the field of battle. "Our
loss," says General Taylor in his official dispatch, "has been
especially severe in officers, twenty-eight having been killed
upon the field. We have to lament the death of Captain
George Lincoln, assistant adjutant-general, serving in the
staff of General Wool&mdash;a young officer of high bearing
and approved gallantry, who fell early in action. No loss
falls more heavily upon the army in the field than that of
Colonels Hardin and McKee, and Lieutenant-colonel Clay.
Possessing in a remarkable degree the confidence of their
commands, and the last two having enjoyed the advantage
of a military education, I had looked particularly to them
for support, in case we met the enemy. I need not say,
that their zeal in engaging the enemy, and the cool and
steadfast courage with which they maintained their positions
during the day, fully realized my hopes, and caused
me to feel yet more sensibly their untimely loss."</p>

<p>The annals of American warfare probably do not furnish
a more remarkable victory than this of Buena Vista, whether
we consider the inequality of the forces engaged&mdash;the character
of the forces, being nearly all volunteers on the American
side, and regular troops on the other&mdash;or the decisive
nature of the victory itself. Most remarkable were the
coolness and gallantry displayed; but it must be remembered
that that coolness and gallantry were, in no slight
degree, the result of those qualities which so eminently distinguished
the commanding general himself.</p>

<p><i>Capture of Vera Cruz.</i>&mdash;Events connected with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_742" id="Page_742">[Pg 742]</a></span>
prosecution of the war, will require us in the next place to
speak of transactions in another quarter of that agitated
and long-distracted country.</p>

<p>Some two hundred miles south-easterly of the capital, on
the Gulf of Mexico, is situated the city of Vera Cruz&mdash;a
place of considerable mercantile importance, and nearly
opposite to which is a small island, on which stands the
castle of San Juan d'Ulloa, a fortress long celebrated for
its impregnable strength.</p>

<p>The reduction of this fortress, and the capture of this most
important maritime town belonging to Mexico, had for some
time engaged the attention of the American government.
For a time, the well-known strength of the fortress, and the
danger arising from the vomito, of garrisoning that and the
city, in case of their reduction, strongly operated against
the enterprise. But their importance to the final and more
speedy termination of the war, at length decided the president
and his advisers to hazard the expedition. It being
impracticable to withdraw General Taylor from the theatre
of his signal victories, the enterprise was intrusted to the
long-tried and accomplished General Scott.</p>

<p>In obedience to his orders, General Scott left Washington
on the 24th of November, on this great and doubtful enterprise.
On the 1st of January, he reached the Rio Grande.
The troops destined for this expedition, among whom was a
considerable portion of the army under General Taylor, were
directed to rendezvous at Lesbos, an island about one hundred
and twenty-five miles north-west of Vera Cruz. From
this point, the army was transported to the west of the island
of Sacrificios. The landing of the troops having been
effected without direct opposition, although the guns and
castles, of the city kept up a constant firing with round
shot and thirteen-inch shells, the several divisions of the
army took their respective positions for the purpose of
investment and siege.</p>

<p>Soon after the commencement of the siege, a "norther"
prevailed, which rendered it impossible to land heavy ordnance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_743" id="Page_743">[Pg 743]</a></span>
On the 17th, a pause occurred in the storm, and ten
mortars, four twenty-four-pound guns, and some howitzers
were landed. On the night of the 18th, the trenches were
opened, and&mdash;engineers, with sappers and miners, leading
the way&mdash;the army gradually closed in nearer the city.</p>

<p>On the 22d of March&mdash;seven of the ten-inch mortars
being in battery, and other works in progress&mdash;General
Scott summoned the governor of Vera Cruz to surrender
the city. This he refused. On the return of the flag, the
mortar-battery, at a distance of eight hundred yards from
the city, opened its fire, and continued to fire during the
day and night.</p>

<p>On the 24th, the batteries were rëinforced with twenty-four
pounders and Paixhan guns. On the 25th, all the
batteries were in "awful activity." Terrible was the scene!
The darkness of the night was illuminated with blazing
shells circling through the air. The roar of artillery, and
the heavy fall of descending shot, were heard throughout
the streets of the besieged city. The roofs of buildings
were on fire. The domes of churches reverberated with
fearful explosions. The sea was reddened with the broadsides
of ships. The castle of San Juan returned from its
heavy batteries the fire, the light, the smoke, the noise of
battle. Such was the sublime and awfully-terrible scene,
as beheld from the trenches of the army, from the 22d to
the 25th of March.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of the 26th, General Landers, on
whom the command had been devolved by General Morales,
made overtures of surrender. Late on the night of the
27th, the articles of capitulation were signed and exchanged.</p>

<p>On the 29th, the official dispatch of General Scott
announced that the flag of the United States floated over
the walls of Vera Cruz and the castle of San Juan d'Ulloa.
The regular siege of the city had continued from the day
of <i>investment</i>, the 12th of March, to the day the articles of
capitulation were signed, the 27th; making a period of <i>fifteen
days</i>, in which active, continuous, vigorous operations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_744" id="Page_744">[Pg 744]</a></span>
were carried on. During this time, our army had thrown
three thousand ten-inch shells, two hundred howitzer shells,
one thousand Paixhan shot, and two thousand five hundred
round shot, weighing, in the whole, about <i>half a million
pounds</i>! Most effective and most terrible was the disaster
and destruction they caused within the walls of the city,
whose ruins and whose mourning attested both the energy
and the sadness of war.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="illus-747.jpg" id="illus-747.jpg"></a>
   <img src="images/illus-747.jpg" alt="The American Army in Vera Cruz." title="The American Army in Vera Cruz."/>
   <p class="caption2">The American Army in Vera Cruz.</p>
</div>

<p>The surrender of the city almost necessarily led to the
surrender of the castle. By the terms of capitulation, five
thousand prisoners were surrendered on parole, and nearly
five hundred pieces of fine artillery were taken. The
number of killed and wounded, on the American side, was
comparatively small. The principal officers killed were
Captains Alburtis and Vinton. The destruction of life fell
heavily upon the Mexicans, and especially upon the citizens
of Vera Cruz, many of whose females and children found
their death from shells falling and bursting in the city.
This, however painful it was, was unavoidable, inasmuch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_745" id="Page_745">[Pg 745]</a></span>
as many, who had ample time to leave the city before the
bombardment commenced, failed to take advantage of that
opportunity.</p>

<p>The fall of Vera Cruz and its neighboring fortress was
the result of cool and determined bravery, but more, perhaps,
of scientific skill and wise calculation. The castle
had long been considered impregnable, and, by many, its
reduction was deemed little short of presumption.</p>

<p><i>Cerro Gordo.</i>&mdash;The victories of Palo Alto, Monterey,
and Buena Vista, under General Taylor, followed, as they
were, by the capture of Vera Cruz, and the fall of that
Mexican Gibraltar, San Juan d'Ulloa, although terribly
disastrous to the Mexicans, had not served to conquer them.
Nothing short of the loss of their capital, it was apparent,
could subdue them; and the occupation of that now became
the one great and controlling object of the commander-in-chief.
Preparations were accordingly made to march upon
the city of Mexico, by the way of Jalapa, Perote, and
Puebla, a distance of about three hundred miles.</p>

<p>On the 12th of April, the American army had reached
the neighborhood of Cerro Gordo, a mountain-pass, sixty
miles from Vera Cruz. Here Santa Anna had collected
about fifteen thousand men, and had made every possible
preparation to resist the progress of the Americans. He
had fortified several eminences, formidable by nature, but
now still more formidable by the batteries, which he had
planted.</p>

<p>Perceiving that a front attack of these works would be
hazardous in the extreme, General Scott directed a road to
be opened around Cerro Gordo, which would enable the
army to ascend the mountain, and gain the rear of the
Mexican works. This was a masterly movement&mdash;the
work of indescribable toil; but when accomplished, it was
apparent to the Mexicans that their fate was sealed. The
consequence was, that one position after another was
obliged to yield, until, at length, but one remained&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_746" id="Page_746">[Pg 746]</a></span>
fortress of Cerro Gordo, the highest and most formidable.
The storming of this was intrusted to Colonel Harney,
supported from various points by Twiggs, Shields, and
Pillow. It was a desperate enterprise, but at length it was
accomplished. Sergeant Henry had the honor of hauling
down the national standard of Mexico. Of the gallant
conduct of Colonel Harney, General Scott was an immediate
witness. When all was effected, approaching the
colonel, between whom and himself there had been some
coolness, he thus addressed him: "Colonel Harney, I cannot
adequately express my admiration of your gallant
achievement, but, at the proper time, I shall take great
pleasure in thanking you in proper terms."</p>

<p>The result of the victory was, three thousand prisoners;
forty-three pieces of brass artillery, manufactured at Seville;
five thousand stands of arms; and the five Generals Penson,
Jarrero, La Vega, Noriega, and Obando.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Mexican commander-in-chief addressed
himself to his own personal safety. In company with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_747" id="Page_747">[Pg 747]</a></span>
Generals Canalizo and Almonte, and some six thousand
men, he made his escape. But he was so hotly pursued,
that he was obliged to leave his carriage, and mount a
mule which was attached to it. Nor was there time to
unharness the animal, but he was detached by summarily
cutting the harness. The carriage was of course abandoned;
and in it, or near it, was found Santa Anna's cork
leg, which, in the haste of the moment, had fallen off; and
to restore which there was now no time. And still more,
his dinner, which had been prepared, was discovered in his
carriage uneaten; and which, after the pursuit was ended,
served as a grateful repast to the several hungry and
weary American officers.</p>

<p><i>Progress of the Army.</i>&mdash;Baffled in his attempt to arrest
the march of the American army, Santa Anna had no
other course but to retreat, as we have related. The way
was now open to the American troops, who advanced upon
Perote; which having garrisoned, they proceeded to the
ancient city of Puebla, in the Spanish tongue <i>Puebla de los
Angelos</i>, the city of angels. Here, for several weeks, the
army rested, waiting for rëinforcements, the troops being
deemed entirely inadequate for so formidable an undertaking
as that of marching on the capital. At length, the
anticipated forces having arrived, preparations were made
to advance. On the 6th of August, 1847, the army consisted
as follows:</p>

<p>This army was arranged in four divisions, with a cavalry
brigade. This brigade was under the command of Colonel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_748" id="Page_748">[Pg 748]</a></span>
Harney. General Worth commanded the first division;
General Twiggs the second; General Pillow the third; and
General Quitman the fourth.</p>

</div>

<p>At length, on the 7th of August, the second division,
under General Twiggs, commenced its march, followed on
the 8th, 9th, and 10th, by the other divisions. No opposing
foe impeded their progress. On the 17th, the army was
concentrated at San Augustine, about ten miles south of
Mexico, on the Acapulco road leading to the city. From
this point, the Americans were destined to meet with the
most formidable resistance. Every possible preparation
had been made by Santa Anna to prevent their access to
and occupation of the city. On the 20th, the drama
opened, and, on that day, several distinct and severe
engagements occurred between the Mexicans and the several
divisions of the American army, the principal of which
were the battles of <i>Contreras</i> and <i>Churubusco</i>. In these
engagements, thirty-two thousand Mexicans were engaged,
and were defeated, and even routed. Three thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_749" id="Page_749">[Pg 749]</a></span>
prisoners were made, including eight generals and two
hundred and five other officers. Four thousand, of all
ranks, were killed and wounded; thirty-seven field-pieces
captured, besides large stores of ammunition. An easy
access to the city now presented itself, and, but for a single
circumstance, the victorious Americans would doubtless
have occupied it that same evening, or early on the ensuing
morning.</p>

<p>Some time previously, the president of the United States,
desirous of ending the war, had deputed a commissioner,
Nicholas P. Trist, Esq., to proceed from Washington to
Mexico, there, if possible, to effect a treaty with that government.
The present was deemed a fit moment, ere the
victors entered the city; and, in order to avoid a forcible
entry, to propose an adjustment of difficulties. Accordingly,
the commander-in-chief decided to pause, and await the
action of its councils. On the 21st, an armistice was
agreed upon. This was followed by consultations between
Mr. Trist and Mexican commissioners, in relation to the
terms of peace. These, however, failed; and infractions of
the armistice having occurred, the conflict was resumed.
On the 8th, the two armies were engaged in a severe action
at <i>Molinos del Rey</i>. In this action, Santa Anna commanded
in person. It continued two hours, and was
attended with great loss on both sides, but resulted in the
triumph of the American arms.</p>

   <p class="caption2">STORMING OF CHEPULTEPEC.</p>
</div>

<p>There remained yet one formidable obstacle to the
entrance of the city. This was the fortress of <i>Chepultepec</i>&mdash;a
natural and isolated mount of great elevation, strongly
fortified at its base and on its acclivities and heights. On
the morning of the 12th, the bombardment and cannonade
of this fortress was commenced, and was continued on the
13th. The Mexicans resisted with stubborn obstinacy,
and, at length, yielded only by dire necessity. The officer
who had the honor of striking the Mexican flag from the
walls, and planting the American standard, was Major
Seymour, of the New England regiment, soon after he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_750" id="Page_750">[Pg 750]</a><br /><a name="Page_751" id="Page_751">[Pg 751]</a></span>
succeeded the gallant Colonel Ransom, who fell while leading
his troops up the heights of Chepultepec.</p>

<p>Such was their position on the night of the 13th. On
the following day, the victorious army entered the ancient
and still proud, but now subjugated city of the Aztecs&mdash;a
place celebrated for its wealth and magnificence&mdash;for its
public squares and public palaces&mdash;its churches and other
beautiful structures&mdash;from the very discovery of the country.
At the capture of Mexico, the effective force of General
Scott did not exceed six thousand.</p>

<p><i>Treaty.</i>&mdash;The occupation of Mexico, by the American
army, essentially terminated the war. A few other engagements,
between detachments of the armies, occurred at
subsequent dates; but the fate of the capital crushed the
hopes and paralyzed the efforts of the Mexicans. In this
posture of affairs, Mr. Trist renewed his proposal for a
treaty between the two republics. At length, this desirable
object was effected, and "a treaty of peace, friendship, and
settlement," was signed at Guadalupe Hidalgo. On its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_752" id="Page_752">[Pg 752]</a></span>
being submitted to the senate of the United States by the
president, a long and exciting debate ensued. But, at length,
after important amendments, it was ratified by a constitutional
majority. To facilitate its ratification by the Mexican
government, and to explain the modifications which it
had undergone, the Hon. Mr. Sevier and Hon. Nathan
Clifford were dispatched to Mexico. On their arrival at
the city of Querataro, on the 25th of May, they found
that the house of deputies had already sanctioned the treaty,
and, on that day, it was adopted by the Mexican senate by
a vote of thirty-three to five.</p>

<p>By this treaty, Upper California and New Mexico were
ceded to the United States. The latter paying to the
former fifteen millions of dollars, in four annual instalments,
and assuming such debts as were due by Mexico to American
citizens, not exceeding three millions and a quarter of dollars.</p>

<p><i>California and its Gold.</i>&mdash;The territories of New Mexico
and Upper California, were known at the time of their
cession to be sufficiently large for a great empire. But, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_753" id="Page_753">[Pg 753]</a></span>
many, they were considered of comparatively little value
to the United States, excepting the bay of San Francisco,
on the Pacific, as a place of harbor for our ships. But,
since their acquisition, California has become, from its mineral
wealth, especially its gold, an object of great interest and
attraction. The whole civilized world has been astonished
by the reports which have been put in circulation respecting
its golden treasures, and thousands upon thousands have
set forth for this western El Dorado.</p>

<p>California is separated into two divisions by a range of
mountains, called the Sierra Nevada, or Snowy Mountains,
which stretches along the coast at the general distance of
one hundred and fifty miles from it. West of this range are
the valleys of San Joaquin and the Sacramento, which are
watered by rivers of the same name. They rise at opposite
ends of these valleys, and at length meet and enter the bay of
Francisco together. The greatest point of interest in this
newly-acquired territory, is the valley of the Sacramento,
which is distinguished by its gold deposites or "<i>placers</i>," as
they are called. The recent discovery of the existence of
gold in this region was accidental. In enlarging the race-way
of a water-wheel, connected with a saw-mill just erected by
a Mr. Marshall for Captain Sutter, by letting in a strong
current of water, a considerable quantity of earth was carried
to the foot of the race. Not long after, Mr. Marshall
discovered some glittering particles in this earth, which, on
further inspection, proved to be virgin gold. Further
explorations ensued, and deposites have been found to exist
in various portions of this valley for several hundred miles.</p>

<p><i>Election of General Taylor.</i>&mdash;The administration of Mr.
Polk was signalized by many interesting and important
events. Yet, it cannot be said to have been popular, even
with the party to which he owed his elevation. Towards the
close of his term, few, if any, seriously advocated his rëelection.
At a democratic convention, held in Baltimore May
21st, 1848, Lewis Cass, of Michigan, was nominated for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_754" id="Page_754">[Pg 754]</a></span>
presidency, and General W. O. Butler, of Kentucky, for the
vice-presidency. The candidates proposed by a whig convention
held at Philadelphia, June 7th, were General Zachary
Taylor, of Louisiana, and Millard Fillmore, of New York.
Subsequently, a free-soil convention assembled at Utica, and
nominated Martin Van Buren. The votes of the several
electoral colleges resulted as follows:</p>

<p>It was an occasion of great rejoicing on Monday, the 5th
of March, when the hero of Buena Vista stood on that spot
at the eastern portico of the national capitol, where had
stood Jefferson, Madison, and others, and baring his head,
took the oath prescribed, to support the constitution, which
was administered to him by Chief Justice Taney.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_756" id="Page_756">[Pg 756]</a></span></p>
<p>The inaugural address of General Taylor, like all his
official communications to government while in the field,
was brief&mdash;shorter than any similar address by any other
president, except Mr. Madison's. To a majority of the
people, it proved quite satisfactory, and even in England
was pronounced an eloquent production. Previous to his
election, General Taylor had declined all pledges, excepting
the assurance to the nation, that he would never be the
president of a party, but should endeavor, if elected, to
bring back the government to the spirit of the constitution,
as understood and administered by Washington. Other
pledges than this, he now declined, standing, as he did,
before God and the nation; but this pledge he was ready
to renew. "In the discharge of these duties," said he, "my
guide will be the constitution, which I this day swear to
'preserve, protect, and defend.' For the interpretation of
that instrument, I shall look to the decisions of the judicial
tribunals established by its authority, and to the practice of
the government under the earliest presidents, who had so
large a share in its formation.</p>

<p>"Chosen by the body of the people, under the assurance
that my administration would be devoted to the welfare of
the whole country, and not to the support of any particular
section or merely local interests, I, this day, renew the
declarations I have heretofore made, and proclaim my fixed
determination to maintain, to the extent of my ability, the
government in its original purity, and to adopt, as the basis
of my public policy, those great republican doctrines which
constitute the strength of our national existence."</p>

<p>The ceremonies of the inauguration being over, General
Taylor entered upon the duties of his office, respected for
his private worth and public services, with many supplications,
on the part of the pious and the patriotic, that his
official course might, in its issues, prove as beneficial to his
country as was Washington's, which he had presented to
himself as the model of his administration.</p>


<p>Taylor's administration continued on page <a href="#Page_902">902</a>.</p>

<p>British America embraces not far from one equal half
of the North American continent. The whole area amounts
to about four millions of square miles. The Arctic ocean
bounds it on the north, and the Atlantic on the east. The
southern boundary is the St. Lawrence, and the extended
chain of lakes as far westward as the Lake of the Woods,
whence the dividing line between the British possessions
and the United States follows the forty-ninth parallel of
latitude westward to the Strait of Fuca, and thence along
its channel south-west to the Pacific ocean. On the west,
British America is bounded in part by the ocean, and in part
by the line of the one hundred and forty-first degree of
west longitude.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_758" id="Page_758">[Pg 758]</a></span></p>

<p>The greater portion of this immense region is a waste,
uninhabited, the home of wild beasts, and the seat of eternal
snow and ice. It possesses little value, except the skins
and furs which are taken from the animals that rove there.
The settlements are few, even in those parts that have been
reduced into provinces, and these embrace but an inconsiderable
portion of the whole region.</p>

<p>It has not been thought important to establish regular
governments in all the provinces, so called. Such governments
are established only in the Canadas, Nova Scotia
and Cape Breton, New Brunswick, Prince Edward's Island,
and Newfoundland. The Canadas consist of Upper and
Lower, or Canada West and Canada East, and embrace
the principal amount of the population and productive
resources of that whole northern world.</p>

<p>Canada East is a country of some considerable extent,
measuring about two hundred thousand square miles, but
mostly hilly and rocky, and unproductive, except on the
borders of the St. Lawrence.</p>

<p>Canada West contains an area of one hundred and fifty
thousand square miles, if its western boundary, as is generally
considered, extends no farther than to the heads of the
streams which fall into Lake Superior. The climate of
Canada West, or Upper Canada, is less severe than that of
Lower Canada. It has also some quite productive soil.</p>

<p><i>Discovery.</i>&mdash;Jacques Carter, of St. Malo, in France, is
the acknowledged discoverer of Canada. He was a distinguished
mariner, and was solicited by the French to conduct
a voyage to Newfoundland. This he undertook with
two small vessels, of only twenty tons burden each. On
the 10th of May, 1534, he saw the shores of that island,
and steering to the south along the coast, landed at a harbor
which he named St. Catharine's. Thence, proceeding
westward and northward, he entered the Gulf of St. Lawrence
and the mouth of the river of the same name; but
the unfavorableness of the weather, and the lateness of the
season, induced him to return to France. He, however,
first took possession of the country in the name of his king.</p>

<p>During the following year, he was invested with the
command of three ships of larger size, and well equipped
with all sorts of supplies; and making a second voyage to
Newfoundland, he entered the gulf on the day of St. Lawrence.
Hence, it is supposed, is the name of the gulf and
of the river. This voyage was not completed till he
reached, in a pinnace and two boats, the present site of
Montreal on the St. Lawrence river. This was then the
principal Indian settlement, named Hochelaga, where the
natives received him with great kindness. He took formal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_760" id="Page_760">[Pg 760]</a></span>
possession of the country in the name of his sovereign, and
returned home in the spring of the following year, 1536.</p>

<p>Voyages of discovery were made successively by Roberval,
Pontgravè, and Champlain, down to the beginning of
the seventeenth century; but of these, no particular notice
need be given.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Settlements.</i>&mdash;The important city of Quebec was founded
by Champlain, in 1608. On the 13th of July of that year,
he fixed on a most commanding promontory, on the north
side of the River St. Lawrence, for the site of his settlement.
The choice of such a spot for "the capital of a
great trans-Atlantic empire, does him immortal honor."
Here he remained through the winter, but, as soon as the
season admitted, he resumed his voyage up the river. At
a distance of twenty-five leagues above Quebec, he met a
band belonging to the celebrated nation of the Algonquins,
whom he agreed to join in their wars against the Iroquois.
In this step, he committed a fatal error. It was the means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_761" id="Page_761">[Pg 761]</a></span>
of bringing upon the French settlements, in Canada, all the
calamities of savage warfare for nearly a hundred years.
He was, however, successful at that time in an engagement
with the Iroquois.</p>

<p>A few years after the settlement of Quebec, viz., in 1611,
Montreal was founded. Champlain, who had in the mean
time returned to France once and again, visited America
that year, arriving at a place of rendezvous appointed for
another warlike expedition. Not finding the Indians, he
employed his time in selecting a spot for a new settlement,
higher up the river than Quebec. Carefully examining the
region, he fixed upon ground in the vicinity of an eminence
which he called Mount Royal; and it would seem from the
prosperity which has since attended the place, under the
name of Montreal, that his choice has been amply justified.
After sowing grain on a cleared spot of some extent, he
inclosed it with a wooden wall. Champlain explored the
River Ottawa, and many other parts of the country, while
he remained in it. In consequence of expeditions from
France, at various times, a few other settlements were
formed; but the colony, though bearing the imposing name
of New France, was in a condition of extreme weakness,
and seemed to be viewed with indifference, both by the
mother-country and England.</p>

<p><i>Capture of Quebec.</i>&mdash;The growth of this place was
very inconsiderable for many years; but it early became a
mark for the assaults of an enemy. Hostilities having
commenced with England, two French subjects, David and
Louis Kirk, entering the service of that country, equipped
a squadron, which sailed to the mouth of the St. Lawrence,
captured several vessels, and intercepted the communication
between the mother-country and the colony. In July,
1629, Sir David Kirk summoned Quebec&mdash;a summons
which was followed by a surrender of the place, the
invaded party being promised honorable conditions, and
allowed to depart with their arms, clothes, and baggage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_762" id="Page_762">[Pg 762]</a></span>
The request of a ship to convey them directly home was
not granted, but they were promised a commodious passage
by way of England. In consequence of the adjustment of
difficulties between the two countries, the place was at
length restored; and Canada, with Cape Breton and Acadia,
was confirmed to France. The final treaty, however, was
not signed till the 29th March, 1632.</p>

<p><i>Death of Champlain.</i>&mdash;Champlain, as the founder of the
most important places in New France, was for a long time
the life and soul of the colony. His energy, scientific
accomplishments, and popularity, seemed to be most intimately
connected with the prosperity, and even existence
of the colony. In 1633, he was appointed governor, and
sailed with a squadron, carrying all necessary supplies, to
Canada, where, on his arrival, he found most of his former
colonists. A greater prosperity now attended the affairs
of New France. Means were employed for maintaining
harmony among the inhabitants, and methods devised for
introducing into the colony only persons of unexceptionable
character.</p>

<p>But the end of his enterprising career was now come.
He perished in the year 1636, having been drowned in the
lake which bears his name. His death was, of course, a
severe misfortune to Canada, and the loss could not well be
repaired. M. de Montmagny was appointed his successor,
and appeared to have commanded the general respect of
the native inhabitants. But the colony was in a critical
condition, and he could act only on the defensive, in the
hostilities in which they were disposed from time to time to
engage. Owing to the policy of the court at home, of
continuing no governor in power longer than three years,
Montmagny was displaced at the end of that time by the
appointment of another governor. This system, however,
was ill-suited to a settlement like that of Canada, where an
intimate local knowledge, and a peculiar mixture of firmness
and address, were necessary to deal with tumultuary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_763" id="Page_763">[Pg 763]</a></span>
tribes whom they were too feeble to subdue. Ailleboust,
his successor, is said to have been a man of probity, but he
indifferently possessed the energy required in so difficult a
situation. The Iroquois now became peculiarly turbulent,
and, as will soon be seen, brought dreadful calamities on
the whites.</p>

<p><i>Religious Enterprises.</i>&mdash;Catholic missionaries had not
merely formed establishments at Quebec and Montreal,
but had also penetrated into the domains of the savages.
These religionists certainly gave full proof of sincerity in
their work, as they renounced all the comforts of civilized
life, and exposed themselves to every species of hardship
and danger. The religious "establishments did little for
the immediate improvement of the colony, yet as points of
possession, occupied by persons whose avocations were
professedly holy and useful, they laid the foundation on
which arose the superstructure of those morals and habits
that still and will long characterize the Gallo-Canadians."</p>

<p>As to the effect of the Catholic missions on the native
tribes, it is to be observed, they undoubtedly reclaimed
their votaries from many savage habits, and trained them
up to some degree of order and industry. The tribe found
to be the most docile and susceptible of improvement, was
that of the Hurons; and their great numbers presented a
wide field for religious effort. More than three thousand
of them are recorded to have received baptism at one
time, though only a portion of the number probably retained
even the profession of Christianity. The general effect
produced was in a degree favorable, and softened somewhat
the aspect of this wild region. The main object was
to unite the Indians in villages. Of these, several were
formed, the principal of which were Sillery, or St. Joseph,
and St. Mary.</p>

<p><i>War made by the Iroquois.</i>&mdash;In 1648, the Iroquois, as
already intimated, were resolved on renewing the war; for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_764" id="Page_764">[Pg 764]</a></span>
what cause, if for any, does not now appear. Their movements
were rapid and fatal. The village of Sillery was
occupied by four hundred families, and was accordingly a
tempting object to the savages. In a time of profound
peace, and while the missionary was celebrating the most
solemn ordinances of religion, the shriek was suddenly heard,
"We are murdered!" The enemy had commenced an
indiscriminate massacre, without distinction of sex or age.
The women fled for safety into the depths of the forest; but
the infants whom they carried in their arms betrayed them
by their crying, and mother and suckling were alike butchered.
The assailants, at length, fell upon the priest, and
after each in succession had struck him a blow, they threw
him into the flames.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

   <img src="images/illus-767.jpg" alt="Extermination of the Hurons." title="Extermination of the Hurons."/>
   <p class="caption2">Extermination of the Hurons.</p>
</div>

<p>By this onset, the Hurons were wholly routed; their
country, which had for some time reposed in peace and
security, became a scene of devastation and blood. Fleeing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_765" id="Page_765">[Pg 765]</a></span>
for refuge in every direction, a few subsequently united
with their invaders, but the greater number sought safety
among the Chippewas of Lake Superior. A small remnant
of about three hundred were able to secure the protection
of the French at Quebec. Here, they were viewed
only as objects of charity; and though, as such, considerable
exertions were put forth in their behalf, yet the whole
number could not be accommodated. Numbers were
exposed to cold and hunger, until a station could be formed
for them, which was named Sillery, after their former chief
settlement. In consequence of the successes of the Iroquois,
the French were chiefly confined to the three forts
of Quebec, Three Rivers, and Montreal. For a number of
years, a sad state of things existed in the colony. The
French had been compelled to accept of humiliating terms
of peace, and even by these means, only partially secured
the boon. The Iroquois continually extended their dominion,
conquering one tribe of their fellow-savages after
another, and even insulting the French in their fortified
posts. The latter, from fear or weakness, were compelled
to witness the destruction of their allies. They were
themselves, in a great measure, safe in their fortresses, for
these the enemy had no adequate skill to besiege.</p>

<p><i>Accessions to the Colony.</i>&mdash;It had been represented to
Louis XIV., who had lately ascended the throne, that his
government was exposing the French name to contempt,
through neglect of his fine American province, and tame
subjection to Indian ravages. He was sufficiently bent
upon aggrandizement not willingly to incur such a reproach;
and accordingly troops were dispatched from France, and
the French power was at once considerably augmented in
the province. The Marquis de Tracy was sent out at this
time, 1665, in the joint character of viceroy and lieutenant-general.
Besides the soldiers, a considerable number of
settlers, including artisans, with horses and cattle, were
conveyed with him to Canada. He was able to overcome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_766" id="Page_766">[Pg 766]</a></span>
and repress the savages, and increase the fortifications and
defences of the country. The population was more than
doubled by means of the immigration.</p>

<p><i>Progress of the Colony.</i>&mdash;After M. de Tracy, the government
was administered successively by M. de Courcelles,
Count Frontenac, M. de la Barre, Denonville, and Count
Frontenac the second time, down to the year 1698. Under
the first-named governor, the French power was gradually
extended to the interior of Canada and the upper parts of
the River St. Lawrence. A settlement of Hurons was
established on the island of Michilimackinack, a situation
very favorable to the fur-trade, and a site for a fort was
selected at Cataraqui, on Lake Ontario, a position of
importance for trade and defence. Count Frontenac, immediately
upon his accession, caused the fort to be completed.
He conducted the affairs of the colony with spirit and
energy during a period of ten years, but he was too independent
in his administration to suit a jealous court at home.
His successor, M. de la Barre, not fulfilling the expectations
of the government, was soon rëcalled, and the Marquis
Denonville appointed in his room. The measures of this
governor were not at all well advised; his treachery to the
natives brought him into difficulty; he obtained only an
empty victory over them, and, towards the conclusion of
his administration, the very existence of the colony was
threatened. At this period, 1689, Frontenac was rëcalled
to the government. It was hoped that his experience
would teach him to avoid the errors of his former administration,
while his decision, energy, and fascinating manners,
were deemed of vital importance to the welfare of the
settlement.</p>

<p>Frontenac, anxious to justify to the world the choice
made of him, the second time, to administer the affairs of
Canada, determined at once on several bold projects. As
his own country and England were now at war, and as
England relied much on the aid of her provinces of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_767" id="Page_767">[Pg 767]</a></span>
south, he resolved on attacking the latter. Accordingly, he
fitted out three expeditions; one against New York, a
second against New Hampshire, and a third against the
province of Maine. The fatal attack upon Corlear, or
Schenectady, detailed in another part of this work, was the
result of the first expedition. The burning of Salmon
Falls, on the borders of New Hampshire, proceeded from
the second expedition. The third destroyed the settlement
of Casco, in Maine.</p>

<p>The atrocities of the French and their savage allies soon
aroused the Northern colonies, New York and New England,
to take vengeance on the foe. The English determined
to strike a blow which might at once deprive him of
all his possessions. Two expeditions were prepared; one
by sea, from Boston, against Quebec; the other by land,
from New York, against Montreal. The first was commanded
by Sir William Phipps, a native of New England,
of humble birth, who had raised himself by his talents to a
high station. Both expeditions failed as to their ultimate
object; but Sir William captured all the French posts in
Acadia and Newfoundland, with several on the St. Lawrence;
and it is not without reason supposed that Quebec
itself would have fallen, had not the English commander
too hastily considered the enterprise as hopeless. He made
a very considerable effort, but did not persevere. The
French, Colden says, returned fervent thanks to Providence
for having, by a special interposition, deprived their enemies
of common sense. Montreal was saved only after a most
strenuous resistance.</p>

<p>The French, under the administration of Frontenac, sustained
themselves, and generally held their own against the
attacks of the English and the Indians. Peace, at length,
having taken place between France and England, negotiations
were entered into for closing the provincial war and
exchanging prisoners; but before the negotiations were
concluded, Frontenac died. This event occurred on the
29th day of November, 1698, and may be said to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_768" id="Page_768">[Pg 768]</a></span>
constituted an era in the Canadian history, as by his energy
and talents he had retrieved the affairs of the settlement,
and raised it into a powerful and flourishing state. De
Callières, the successor of Frontenac, finally effected the
negotiations in 1700.</p>

<p><i>Attempts by the English to Conquer Canada</i>.&mdash;The first
serious attempt to bring the French province of Canada
under the English sway, and its failure, have already been
chronicled. Other efforts were subsequently put forth with
this object in view, as soon as the parent countries had
again taken up arms on account of the Spanish succession.
Canada, in this instance, was left to her own resources, as
Louis XIV. had been entirely unsuccessful in his European
wars, and could afford her no aid. She was at this time,
also, able to repel her invaders, or was providentially
delivered from their attack.</p>

<p>De Vaudreuil, who was then governor, in contemplation
of a formidable attack, sought to dissipate it by an offensive
movement. He sent out a detachment of two hundred
men, which, after a long march, succeeded in storming
and destroying Haverhill, a frontier village; though, while
returning, they fell into an ambuscade. Thirty of their
number were killed; but having beaten off their assailants,
the remainder reached Montreal in safety.</p>

<p>In 1709, the English left New York for Canada with a
force of two thousand men, joined by an equal number of
savages. But after they had erected a chain of posts from
New York, and had occupied, in great force, Lakes George
and Champlain, circumstances occurred which defeated the
project. The savages, who were the Iroquois, failed them
from prudential considerations; and a pestilential disease
happening among the English troops, the enterprise was
abandoned, after their canoes and forts were burned to ashes.</p>

<p>The succeeding year, the English prepared a new and
greater armament. General Nicholson arrived at Boston
with a considerable squadron and fresh forces were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_769" id="Page_769">[Pg 769]</a></span>
expected, which, with those already in the country, were
to be employed in two joint expeditions, by sea against
Quebec, and by land against Montreal. But it happened,
to the signal relief of the French, that the squadron was
wrecked near the mouth of the St. Lawrence, a circumstance
which prevented also the land forces, that were
already on the march, from proceeding farther. The
treaty at Utrecht, which took place on the 30th of March,
1713, put an end, for many years, to their armaments for
the reduction of Canada. The long interval proved to
be a season of prosperity to this French domain in the
New World.</p>

<p><i>Condition of Canada in 1721 and 1722.</i>&mdash;This was the
time when Charlevoix visited the colony, who gave a
description of its state as he saw it.</p>

<p>Quebec was estimated to contain about seven thousand
inhabitants; both the lower and the upper town were partially
built, but none of the extensive suburbs appear to
have existed. The society, composed in a great measure
of military officers and noblesse, was extremely agreeable,
and no where was the French language spoken in greater
purity. Under this gay exterior, however, was concealed
a very general poverty.</p>

<p>The only employment suited to their taste was the fur-trade.
This, connected as it was with habits of roving
and adventure, had great attractions for the people, and
little fortunes were thereby occasionally made; but these
were soon dissipated in the haste to enjoy pleasure and
display. The absence of gold and silver, then considered
almost the only objects as giving lustre to a colony, had
always caused New France to be viewed as of less importance
than it was in reality.</p>

<p>The coasts of the St. Lawrence, for some extent below
Quebec, were already laid out in seignories, and tolerably
cultivated. At a place seven leagues from the capital,
many of the farmers were found in easy circumstances, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_770" id="Page_770">[Pg 770]</a></span>
more wealthy than their landlords. The latter were in
possession of grants which they had neither capital nor
industry to improve, and they were, therefore, obliged to
let them out at small quit-rents.</p>

<p>The island and city of Montreal presented to the eye
objects of deep interest. The population was considerable,
as both the upper and lower towns were already built, and
a suburb had been commenced. Montreal was rendered
comparatively secure against the savages, by the vicinity
of two neighboring villages which were inhabited by
friendly Indians.</p>

<p><i>General Prosperity of the Colony.</i>&mdash;Canada enjoyed a
long period of tranquillity, under the administrations of De
Vaudreuil and Beauharnois, Gallissonière, Jonquière, Longuiel,
and Du Quesne and his successors.</p>

<p>During this interval, the French appear to have entirely
overcome that deeply-seated enmity, so long cherished by
the great Indian tribes. Their pliant and courteous manners,
their frequent intermarriages, and, in some instances,
actual adoption of the habits of savage life, rendered them
better fitted than the English, to secure the confidence of
the American savage. Instead of having to treat them as
British allies, they could usually employ them, when occasion
required, for their own military service.</p>

<p>An equally favorable change took place in respect to the
fur-trade, which had been considerably diverted to the
English market. A more liberal system appears to have
been adopted; and a large annual fair, opened at Montreal,
became the general centre of the traffic.</p>

<p><i>Canada transferred to the English.</i>&mdash;In an early portion
of the volume, we have given an account of the "French
and Indian war," during which an expedition against Quebec,
under Wolfe, was attempted. This was in 1759. That
expedition resulted, as is well known, in the death of that
distinguished military hero, and the capitulation of the city.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_771" id="Page_771">[Pg 771]</a></span>
A single incident, only, will be here alluded to, touching
the fall of this victorious general. On receiving his mortal
wound, he said, "Support me&mdash;let not my brave soldiers
see me drop." About a year following the surrender of
Quebec, the whole of Canada was transferred to the
dominion of Great Britain, by which it has ever since been
held as one of her dependencies.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Refusal to join in the War of American Independence.</i>&mdash;In
the revolt of the United Colonies against the government
of the mother-country, the Canadians were pressingly
invited to join and assist the former. They, however, never
swerved from their allegiance. With a view to conciliate
the Canadians, the "Quebec Act," passed in 1774, changed
the English civil law, which had been at first introduced,
for the ancient system. The French language was also
directed to be employed in the law-courts, and other
changes were made for the purpose of gratifying the
people. The most important privilege of all, that of a
national representation, was, however, not granted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_772" id="Page_772">[Pg 772]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Consequence of the American Independence to Canada.</i>&mdash;The
issue of the war of independence in the colonies,
though unfavorable, or at least mortifying, to the mother-country,
was attended with some advantages to Canada.
A large body of loyalists, who had sought refuge in her territories
during the war, received liberal grants of land in the
Upper Provinces, as also farming utensils, building materials,
and subsistence for two years. A great extent of
country was thus put under cultivation, and flourishing
towns, as those of Kingston and Toronto, arose from the
policy which was adopted in regard to these settlers.
Thus was laid the foundation of that prosperity which has
since so eminently distinguished the Upper Province.</p>

<p><i>Territorial Division and a Constitution.</i>&mdash;A steady
advancement and growth of the country, caused the population
to feel more and more their importance, and they
were little contented in the absence of a representative
government. The wish for such a government was, at
times, strongly expressed. In 1790, Mr. Pitt determined
to comply with the desires of the people on this subject;
but, as a preliminary, it was resolved to divide Canada into
two governments, upper and lower. The constitution
granted, proved to be on a basis nearly resembling that of
the British constitution. The first house of assembly was
opened in 1792, but for several years their proceedings were
of no special importance. In 1797, General Prescott was
called to administer the government, when complaints
began to be made respecting the grant of lands. The
Board constituted for that purpose, had appropriated extensive
tracts to themselves, and thereby had impeded the
work of general settlement. He was succeeded, however,
in 1800, by Sir Robert S. Milnes, as lieutenant-governor.
A few years afterwards, a decision of the chief justice of
Montreal declared slavery inconsistent with the laws of
the country, and the small number of slaves then living
there received a grant of freedom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_773" id="Page_773">[Pg 773]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Dissensions after the Close of the War of</i> 1812.&mdash;The
contests in which Canada was involved with the United
States, during the war of the latter with England, from
1812 to 1815, an account of which the reader will find in a
prior part of the volume, had scarcely closed, before the
country was disturbed by internal dissensions, particularly
the Lower Province. They arose chiefly from the jealousies
which existed between the different branches of the
government. Indeed, as early as 1807, the assembly seriously
complained of an undue influence exercised by the
executive and judicial officers. The difficulties continued
through successive administrations, with partial suspensions
under compliant or conciliatory governors, until the government
came into the hands of Sir Francis Burton, who, by
yielding all the points in dispute, succeeded in conciliating
the assembly. The principal subject of dispute had been
the public revenue and its appropriation.</p>

<p>But the conciliation was not lasting. Every concession
to the assembly gave rise to new demands, and the right
was now claimed of an uncontrolled disposal of the entire
revenue. Lord Dalhousie, who resumed office in 1826,
resisted the demand, and the dissensions were of course
renewed. Their violence was, indeed, much increased.
On the meeting of the assembly in 1827, Mr. Papineau was
chosen speaker, an appointment which, on account of his
violent opposition to the measures of government, Lord
Dalhousie refused to sanction. But the assembly being in
no mood to recede from its position, the consequence was,
that no session was held in the winter of 1827-28.</p>

<p>Discontent had now risen to an alarming height; and, in
the latter year, a petition was presented to the king, signed
by eighty-seven thousand inhabitants, complaining of the
conduct of successive governors. The subject was brought
before parliament, and a committee reported the expediency
of a thorough and effectual redress, admitting, generally,
that the grievances complained of were well-founded. Sincere
attempts appear to have been made to carry out the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_774" id="Page_774">[Pg 774]</a></span>
provisions of the report, or measures of reform which had
been promised; but, in the course of the colonial government,
the claims of the crown and those of the assembly,
on certain points, proved to be conflicting. The breach
which was hoped to be closed, now became wider than
ever. The assembly began to specify conditions on which
certain salaries should be paid to the colonial officers; and,
as a fundamental reform, next demanded that the legislative
council, hitherto appointed by the crown, should be abolished,
and a new one, like that of the American senate,
substituted in its place, composed of members elected by
the people. A petition to this effect was transmitted to the
king, early in 1833, signed by Papineau. The British
ministry, however, scouted at once such a proposal, and
hinted the possibility of summary measures on the part of
parliament, in order to compose the internal dissensions of
the colonies. This was an imprudent intimation.</p>

<p>Both the refusal and the inuendo but added fuel to the
flame. The assembly refused to pass any bill of supply
whatever for the year 1834, and in a more resolute manner
than heretofore, insisted on an elective legislative
council. The next governor who was sent out, the Earl
of Gosford, professed conciliatory views; but his real object
was otherwise, as was accidentally discovered. The real
instructions with which he was charged, were common to
him and to the governor of the Upper Province; but the
latter had made public a part of those instructions apparently
without the knowledge of Lord Gosford's intentions.
The rage of the popular leaders now knew no bounds;
they complained not only of the disappointments they had
experienced, but of the deception which had been practiced
upon them. The assembly, as before, withheld the supplies,
and made no provision for the public services.</p>

<p><i>Disturbances and Insurrection.</i>&mdash;A crisis had now arrived.
Ministers determined no longer to postpone measures for
counteracting the proceedings of the popular party, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_775" id="Page_775">[Pg 775]</a></span>
placing the executive government in a state of regular action.
The death of the king, meanwhile, the necessity of a dissolution
of the parliament, and the unwillingness to begin the
government of a young and popular queen by a scheme of
coercion, caused a delay in the execution of the designs of
government. The expedient of advancing the amount
required for the public service, by way of loan from the
British revenue, was substituted by ministers, in the prospect
of being ultimately reimbursed from the provincial fund.
The ball, however, was set in motion, and such was the
momentum, that it could not be stopped at once. Meetings
were held in the counties of Montreal and Richelieu, in
which it was affirmed, that the votes of the Commons,
(declaring the elective legislative council and the direct
responsibility of the executive to the assembly, inexpedient,)
had put an end to all hopes of justice. A general
convention was proposed, to consider what further means
were advisable, and a recommendation was made to discontinue
the consumption of British manufactures, and of all
articles paying taxes.</p>

<p>This state of things put the government on the alert;
preparations were made to have in readiness for the public
service an additional regiment from Nova Scotia and New
Brunswick. A proclamation, also, was issued, warning the
people against all attempts to seduce them from their allegiance.
Meetings of the friends of the government were
held in Montreal and Quebec, condemning the house of
assembly, declaring attachment to the British connexion,
and deprecating disorganization and revolution. Notwithstanding
all the attempts of the governor to effect a
compromise, an agreement in respect to the topics in dispute
could not be brought about. A recourse to arms
appears now to have been determined upon by the popular
leaders, with the avowed object of effecting an entire
separation from the parent state. The efforts made to
arouse the spirit of independence were considerable, though
more secret than formerly, until an association was formed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_776" id="Page_776">[Pg 776]</a></span>
under the title of the Sons of Liberty, who even paraded
the streets of Montreal in a hostile and threatening manner.
Other measures of defiance, in different parts of the country,
were resorted to, having in view still more directly the ultimate
object of resistance and independence. The recent
appointments of the two councils, designed as an alleviation,
in part, of the people's complaints, were declared wholly
unsatisfactory, while the introduction of an armed force
into the province was stigmatized as a new and outrageous
grievance.</p>

<p>The government could not overlook these incipient steps
of an insurrection. Additional military force was called
into requisition&mdash;loyal volunteer associations were formed
as an offset to those of the other party, and the Catholic
clergy were zealous in their endeavors to preserve the
peace. A scene of violence occurred in the streets, November
6th, 1837, between the two parties, in which the
loyalists proved to be the stronger body. That event, as
might be expected, increased the ferment; so that the government,
as the most effectual course to put a stop to the
aggressive movement of the people, arrested at Montreal
a number of the most conspicuous leaders, with the exception
of Papineau, who had disappeared. A part of these,
however, were subsequently rescued&mdash;a fight ensued between
the militia employed on this occasion, who amounted
only to thirty, and a body of three hundred well-armed men,
protected by a high fence. The former, of course, was
overcome.</p>

<p>In adopting the prompt measures which were now
deemed necessary by the government, strong detachments
under Colonels Gore and Wetherall were sent to the village
of St. Denis and St. Charles on the Sorel, to rout the
armed bodies of insurgent assembled in those places, under
Papineau, Brown, and Neilson. Gore was repulsed; but
Wetherall, on the 26th of November, attacking a force of
one thousand men, came off victorious, having killed and
wounded nearly three hundred of the enemy. This latter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_777" id="Page_777">[Pg 777]</a></span>
affair decided the fate of the contest in that quarter. Terror
seized the minds of the peasantry, and they began to
consider themselves betrayed by their leaders. A few
days subsequently, Neilson, one of the commanders of the
insurgent forces, was taken in a barn, conveyed into Montreal,
and thrown into prison. Papineau, however, could
not be discovered.</p>

<p>In other portions of the province, where the insurrection
had been still more formidable, the government forces were
successful. At St. Eustache and the village of St. Benoit,
the most bloody scenes were enacted; and there seems to
have been at the latter place, after the regular battle, a
wanton and barbarous destruction of human life, on the part
of the enraged royalists. At the close of the year 1837, the
whole Lower Province was reduced to a state of tranquillity.</p>

<p>In the mean time, Upper Canada had become the theatre
of interesting events. A party had arisen, influenced by
inhabitants who had emigrated from the United States;
who, advancing from step to step in discontent, at length,
scarcely made any secret of their desire to separate from
the mother-country, and join the American Union. In 1834,
this party, for the first time, obtained a majority in the
assembly, and after making or finding causes of disagreement
with the governor of the province, Sir Francis Head,
at length stopped the supplies, after the example of the
Lower Province. Sir Francis then reserved all their
money bills for her majesty's decision, and rejected application
for the payment of their incidental expenses. To
settle the difficulties, if possible, he made an appeal to the
people by a new election. This resulted favorably to the
constitutional side, and restored tranquillity till the time of
the outbreak in the Lower Province. That occasion was
seized by Mackenzie, one of the chief leaders at the head
of five hundred men, to put his plans in operation, and
attempt a separation of the province from Great Britain.
His design of taking Toronto by surprise was, however,
defeated. Upon the manifestation of force on the part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_778" id="Page_778">[Pg 778]</a></span>
the loyal inhabitants, he retired, his followers were easily
dispersed, and a number of them taken prisoners. A large
body of the militia had assembled for the defence of the
government; but they were given to understand that they
might now return to their homes. Only such a portion
was retained, under Colonel M'Nab, as was wanted to bring
Duncombe, another leader, to terms, which was effected.</p>

<p>Mackenzie, fleeing to Buffalo, created an interest in favor
of the patriots among a portion of the American people,
who, on the northern frontier, had been accustomed to
sympathize in their attempts at independence. Bodies of
men with their leaders, from the American side, took possession
of Navy island, situated in the Niagara channel,
between Grand island and the British shore. This they
fortified with cannon, and designed as the seat of offensive
operations. But Mr. Van Buren, the American president
at that time, interposed his authority at once to arrest these
hostile proceedings, so far as his countrymen were concerned,
and sent General Scott to the scene of action, that
a strict neutrality might be enforced. It was during this
period that the small steamer, named Caroline, as has been
already related in the present work, was burned by the
British. This attack had nearly proved fatal to the peace
of the country; it did not, however, arrest the vigorous
measures adopted by General Scott to fulfil the objects of
his mission. The force now collected against the insurgents,
became so far formidable, that they evacuated the
island on the 14th of January, 1838. The spirit of insurrection
was now laid, but much remained to be done to
effect a satisfactory adjustment of the difficulties between
the government and the disaffected. The great reputation
of Lord Durham, who was appointed governor in May,
1838, it was hoped would render his action favorable to
such an object; but he was soon called upon to decide
upon a delicate and difficult question, viz: the treatment of
the prisoners taken in the rebellion. Upon a confession of
guilt, he sentenced them to be deported to Bermuda, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_779" id="Page_779">[Pg 779]</a></span>
to be kept there in strict surveillance. Should they ever
return to Canada without leave of the governor, they were
to suffer the penalty of death. The same was awarded to
Papineau and others, implicated in the late insurrection,
but who had fled the country. This procedure created
not a little excitement in the home government, it being
deemed an usurpation of power not belonging to the governor-general
of a province. A grant of indemnity, however,
was passed in his case; but Lord Durham was not
of a temperament to brook this interposition, and he soon
threw up his administration, and left for England on the 1st
of November. No sooner had he departed, than fresh
troubles arose. The spirit of disaffection was rife, and
hopes were inspired through the aid which American sympathizers
might afford. Communications were secretly
kept up with the latter. But miserable success attended
the operations of the insurgents. Dr. Robert Nelson, at the
head of four thousand men, failed completely to make an
impression, and, threatened by the government forces at his
quarters at Napierville, he and his company dispersed without
firing a shot.</p>

<p>In Upper Canada, Sir Francis Head had already resigned.
His successor, Sir George Arthur, soon found himself involved
in difficult circumstances. Bands of lawless individuals,
to the number of several hundreds, on several occasions
crossed from the American side; but were, in general,
effectually repulsed with little loss to the British. The
captives taken were treated with a severity which had not
before been exercised towards that misguided and unfortunate
class of people. They were generous in their
sympathy, but they had violated the laws of civilized
communities, and were liable to a just retribution. A
considerable number of the most conspicuous were immediately
shot, and the rest condemned to severe or ignominious
punishments. The "Canadian Rebellion," was closed by
these occurrences. The whole history of their efforts
showed that the Canada people were unprepared, at that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_780" id="Page_780">[Pg 780]</a></span>
period, for an undertaking of such vast magnitude and
imminent peril.</p>

<p>In 1840, by an act of the imperial parliament, Upper and
Lower Canada were united into one, under the name of
the Province of Canada. Some changes were made in
the form of the government; but only a few of the causes
of grievance have been removed, and the great body of the
people are still abridged to a considerable degree, in respect
to the choice of their rulers, or the free enactment of the
laws of the state. Still more recently, the province has
been thrown into great excitement by an attempt to pay,
from the public exchequer, the losses sustained by those
who took part in the Canadian rebellion. What the result
of these stormy times will be, the future only can disclose.</p>

<p><i>Limits.</i>&mdash;Nova Scotia is a large peninsula on the south-eastern
part of British America, united to the continent by
a narrow isthmus, between Chignecto bay and the Gulf of
St. Lawrence. It is three hundred and eighty-eight miles
in length from north-east to south-west, and contains an area
of sixteen thousand square miles. It is a rough, mountainous
country, barren on the sea-board, but very fertile in
some of the interior parts.</p>

<p><i>Settlement.</i>&mdash;De Monts, a French gentleman, sailing from
France with a view to settlement in this part of America,
touched, in the first instance, at Nova Scotia, on the 16th
May, 1604; but no settlement was effected until the year
after, and that was at Port Royal (now Annapolis). The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_782" id="Page_782">[Pg 782]</a></span>
whole country, including New Brunswick, was then known
by the name of Acadia. The settlement above spoken of
was soon after, in 1614, broken up by Argall, an English
captain, engaged in the Virginia settlement. The whole
region was viewed with indifference on the part of the
English, because it did not contain gold and silver. They,
however, made an attempt, under Sir William Alexander,
to occupy it, some years after Argall's success against Port
Royal; but were obliged to desist, from finding it in possession
of the French. In 1628 and 1629, the English
succeeded in taking Nova Scotia and Canada; but by the
terms of a treaty in 1632, the whole country was restored
to France.</p>

<p><i>Conquest by the English.</i>&mdash;A period of several years was
passed in the infelicities of a deadly feud between the rival
chiefs who held possession of the country. But amidst their
contentions, an expedition was sent against Nova Scotia in
1654 by Cromwell, who had then declared war against
France; and the result was the reduction of the warring
parties, and the submission of the whole country to the
English authority. This was but a temporary acquisition.
By the peace of 1667, Nova Scotia was again ceded to the
French.</p>

<p>In the course of a few subsequent years, Nova Scotia was
twice invaded and taken by the English from the colony of
Massachusetts; the first time under Sir William Phipps, and
the second time by a body of five hundred men from Boston.
Acadia was now held by the British until the treaty of Ryswick
in 1697, when it again reverted to France.</p>

<p><i>Permanent Annexation to the British Crown.</i>&mdash;There
was a speedy return of the war between France and England,
and the reduction of Nova Scotia was again left to
New England. The first expedition, under Colonel Church,
and a subsequent one, three years after, effected little for
the object in view. The determination of the New Englanders,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_783" id="Page_783">[Pg 783]</a></span>
however, could not be shaken. After two years
spent in preparing, they assembled a large force of five
regiments; and under the command of General Nicholson,
they arrived at Port Royal on the 24th of September, 1716,
which in its weakness capitulated without resistance. The
month following, when the deed of surrender was made,
forms the era of the permanent annexation of Nova Scotia
to the British crown.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> The Indians of the country, who
were strongly attached to the French, were not satisfied
with the transfer, and for many years became extremely
troublesome to the English, frequently surprising them, and
carrying off their property. It was in the course of these
disturbances, that the Massachusetts troops in 1728 defeated
the tribe of the Noridgewocks; among the results of which
invasion, was the death of the celebrated Father Rolle,
their missionary.</p>

<p><i>Policy of England in relation to the Country.</i>&mdash;After the
treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle 1748, which had been preceded
by disasters to the French possessions in America, particularly
by the taking of Louisburg, Great Britain began to
pay more attention to Nova Scotia. Hitherto, it had been
quite a French country, peopled and cultivated throughout
by that hostile nation. It was suggested, that of the large
number of soldiers and sailors discharged in consequence
of the peace, a part might with great advantage be located
as agriculturists, and thereby provide the colony with an
English population. This project was embraced with ardor
by the Earl of Halifax.</p>

<p>Fifty acres were allowed to every private, with ten additional
for each member of his family. A higher allowance
was granted to officers, in proportion to their rank. By this
arrangement, three thousand seven hundred and sixty adventurers
with their families were induced to embark in May,
1749. They were landed, not at Annapolis, but Chebucto,
named henceforth Halifax, after the patron of the expedition.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_784" id="Page_784">[Pg 784]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Situation of the English Settlers.</i>&mdash;As munificent provision
was made for them from time to time, a town, with
spacious and regular streets, was soon reared; where they
were as comfortably situated as they could be with a hostile
population in their vicinity, and the difficulties arising from
the French claims. The boundaries of the country were
in dispute between the two nations&mdash;the encroachments of
the English, as the French settlers deemed them, alarmed
the fears of the latter; and the Indians, excited by French
emissaries, committed upon the English numerous outrages.
At length, the French arose in rebellion against the British
rule; but it was not until after many attempts to subdue
them, on the part of the English, that the object was effected.
The success of the last expedition, under Colonel Monckton,
in 1755, from New England, secured the tranquillity of all
French Acadia, then claimed by the English under the
name of Nova Scotia.</p>

<p><i>English Treatment of the French Acadians.</i>&mdash;The English,
in consequence of the war which now raged between
France and Britain, did not feel at ease. They had reason
to believe that, in the event of an invasion of Nova Scotia
by the French, they would find not only the Indians, but
the Acadians, friendly to the invaders. A cruel expedient,
hardly justified by the circumstances, was adopted to prevent
the danger and evil. It was determined to break up
the homes of the latter, and disperse them throughout the
British colonies, so that they might be unable to unite in
offensive measures. They were comfortably situated, and
attached to their homes; were a quiet people, only a few
of them ever having been openly engaged in arms against
the British; and, consequently, they could not but keenly
feel the greatness of their wrongs. They submitted to them,
but with moans and pathetic appeals, though occasional
forcible resistance was offered.</p>

<p>"Notwithstanding the barbarous diligence with which
this mandate was executed, it is not supposed that the number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_785" id="Page_785">[Pg 785]</a></span>
actually deported exceeded seven thousand. The rest
fled into the depth of the forest, or to the nearest French
settlements, enduring incredible hardships. To prevent the
return of the hapless fugitives, the government reduced to
ashes their habitations and property, laying waste their own
lands with a fury exceeding that of their most savage enemy.
In one district, two hundred and sixty-three houses were at
once in a blaze. The Acadians, from the heart of the woods,
beheld all they possessed consigned to destruction; yet they
made no movement till the devastators wantonly set their
chapel on fire. They then rushed forward in desperation,
killed about thirty of the incendiaries, and then hastened
back to their hiding-place."&mdash;Such is the account given by
an eloquent historian of this barbarous proceeding.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="illus-788.jpg" id="illus-788.jpg"></a>
   <img src="images/illus-788.jpg" alt="DESTRUCTION OF ACADIE." title="DESTRUCTION OF ACADIE."/>
</div>

<p><i>Condition of the Acadians.</i>&mdash;By the peace which was
concluded at Paris, in 1763, France was compelled to
transfer to her victorious rival all her possessions on the
North American continent. After the peace, the case of the
Acadians was necessarily taken into consideration. The
severe treatment to which they had been subjected brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_786" id="Page_786">[Pg 786]</a></span>
no advantage to the country, as it had not become the theatre
of war, and there no longer remained any pretext for continuing
the persecution. Though transportation was advised
by the governor, yet the administration at home, with a
more equitable spirit, allowed them to return to their original
places of abode, receiving lands on taking the customary
oaths. Yet the justice rendered was imperfect, inasmuch
as no compensation was allowed them for their plundered
property.</p>

<p>It, however, pleased a number to return, though in 1772
the whole body was found to be only two thousand one
hundred; an eighth-part, perhaps, of what had constituted
once a flourishing colony. They have since, by their
industry, brought themselves into a thriving state.</p>

<p><i>State of the Province during the War of the United
States.</i>&mdash;The condition of Nova Scotia, as indeed of the
adjoining British provinces on the North, was highly critical
during the war of the American Revolution; but the
fears indulged from this source proved unfounded. The
province remained loyal to the crown during the whole of
that long and arduous contest. At its close, there was a
large influx of refugees into the province. The number
that arrived, prior to September, 1783, was reckoned at
eighteen thousand, and two thousand more landed in the
following month.</p>

<p>"Many of these new citizens possessed considerable
property, as well as regular and industrious habits, so that
they formed a most important acquisition. Several additional
townships were erected; Shelburne, before nearly
deserted, rapidly acquired upwards of ten thousand inhabitants;
emigrants from Nantucket established a whale-fishery
at Dartmouth; while saw and grist mills were established
in various parts of the province. A considerable proportion
of these emigrants directed their course to the region
beyond the peninsula; which thereby acquiring a great
increase of importance, was, in 1784, erected into a distinct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_787" id="Page_787">[Pg 787]</a></span>
government, under the title of New Brunswick." Cape
Breton, from the above date, after having been separated
from Nova Scotia until 1820, was rëannexed to the latter.</p>

<p><i>Results of the War of 1812.</i>&mdash;The war between the
United States and Great Britain, which broke out in 1812,
materially advanced the prosperity of Nova Scotia, and
showed the importance of Halifax as a naval station. Into
this port numerous prizes were carried, by the sale of which
large fortunes were realized. The evils of war were
almost unknown, for a neutrality was observed by the government
of Maine and the British authorities on the New
Brunswick frontier; so that although the militia were kept
in readiness for service, they were not called into it. A
long succession of able governors since, has been the
means of giving to the province a desirable increase of
wealth and prosperity. The importance of Halifax has,
within a few years, been greatly increased, by becoming a
touching place for the royal English steamers (Cunard line)
in their transit across the Atlantic.</p>

<h2><a name="III_NEW_BRUNSWICK" id="III_NEW_BRUNSWICK">III. NEW BRUNSWICK.</a></h2>



<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Extent</span>&mdash;Physical Aspect and Soil&mdash;Settlement and Progress&mdash;Signal
Calamity.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Extent.</i>&mdash;New Brunswick is a territory which forms a
kind of irregular square, lying on the east of the state of
Maine, though extending farther north than that state, and
therefore bounded west by a portion of Canada. It comprises
an area of more than twenty-seven thousand square
miles, and hence its surface considerably exceeds that of
Nova Scotia and Cape Breton united.</p>

<p><i>Physical Aspect and Soil.</i>&mdash;The surface of the country
is broken and undulating, though scarcely any where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_788" id="Page_788">[Pg 788]</a></span>
rising into mountains. The fertility of the soil is greater
than that of Nova Scotia, and is especially indicated by the
magnificent forests with trees of enormous size, the export
of which for timber and shipping constitutes the chief
occupation of the colonists. The borders of the streams
consist of the richest meadow lands. The climate, like
that of Canada, is excessively cold from November to
April. At the latter period comes a sudden change, bringing
intense heat and rapid vegetation.</p>

<p><i>Settlement and Progress.</i>&mdash;Previously to 1783, the French
comprehended the territory now called New Brunswick,
under the general appellation of New France, viewing it
more particularly as an appendage to Acadia. At that
period, it received its present name and its existence as a
colony. The English claimed it as a part of Nova Scotia,
though they paid no attention to its improvement.</p>

<p>After that peninsula had been finally ceded to the English,
the French laid claim to New Brunswick as a part of
Canada, and made preparations to enforce it by arms. But
the subject was put to rest finally by the cession of all Canada
to the British, at the peace of 1763. It only remained
to be populated and improved by enterprising people from
abroad, as it was inhabited mainly by the few Acadians who
had sought refuge from persecution among its forests.</p>

<p>A people of this description soon came, or more properly
had emigrated to New Brunswick, the year before the era
of the peace above referred to. They consisted of families
from New England, who settled at Mangerville, about fifty
miles up the St. John, and, in 1783, they amounted to about
eight hundred. At the close of the revolutionary war,
several thousand of disbanded British troops removed from
New England, were located at Frederickton. The new
colonists, however, were subjected to great hardships and
cruel privations, when first placed in the midst of this wilderness,
which they more keenly felt from the fact that they
had been accustomed to the comforts of civilized life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_789" id="Page_789">[Pg 789]</a></span></p>

<p>Great exertions were made for the improvement of the
country under General Sir Guy Carlton, who was appointed
governor in 1785. A degree of success attended his efforts,
as a gradual advancement took place. During a period of
fourteen years from the time he left the country, the government
was administered by a succession of presidents.
By an arrangement of duties on foreign timber, and by leaving
that from New Brunswick free, a foundation was laid for
the signal prosperity of the colony. This state of things
commenced in 1809, and the exports of this article, from
that period, continually increased, until it reached its acme in
1825. Then a severe rëaction was experienced, in consequence
of speculative over-trading. The trade, however,
assumed a healthy condition in the space of a few years.</p>

<p>The progress of the colony of late years has been cheering,
and its natural advantages appreciated, as they have
been the more unfolded. It was during the administration
of Sir John Harvey, that the disputed boundary between
Maine and New Brunswick had nearly occasioned a rupture
between the United States and Great Britain. This
source of danger to the peace of both countries, was
removed, as elsewhere related, by a treaty in 1842, which
settled the question to the satisfaction of those concerned.</p>

<p><i>Signal Calamity.</i>&mdash;We may not conclude this brief
notice of New Brunswick without giving some account
of an awful calamity which, in 1828, befel that part of this
province which borders on the Mirimachi. In October of
that year, during the prevalence of a long drought, the
pine forests caught fire. Being filled with resinous substance,
and the fire being driven by a high wind, the conflagration
was impelled with the most awful rapidity. Its
sound was like uninterrupted thunder&mdash;its column rose two
hundred feet above the loftiest pine. Next was seen, as it
were, an ocean of flame, rolling towards New Castle and
Douglas; all resistance was vain; these towns were reduced
to ashes. The miserable inhabitants, abandoning their all,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_790" id="Page_790">[Pg 790]</a></span>
rushed to the bank, and threw themselves into boats, canoes,
on rafts or logs, to convey them down to Chatham; but several,
of both sexes, were either killed or severely injured.
The flames spread a vast distance into the country, destroying
magnificent forests and numerous cattle; even wild
beasts and birds were drawn into them by a sort of fascination.
The benevolence of the neighboring British provinces
and of the United States was most liberally exerted on the
distressing occurrence. The towns which were destroyed,
have since that time been rebuilt.</p>

<h2><a name="IV_PRINCE_EDWARDS_ISLAND" id="IV_PRINCE_EDWARDS_ISLAND">IV. PRINCE EDWARD'S ISLAND.</a></h2>



<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Location</span>, Surface, and Climate&mdash;Early Settlers&mdash;Change of Possession&mdash;Plans
of Colonization&mdash;Character of late Governors&mdash;Inhabitants.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Location, Surface, and Climate.</i>&mdash;Prince Edward, formerly
St. John, is an interesting island, lying in the southern
part of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. It has a very
winding outline and a crescent-like form, and is deeply
indented by bays and inlets. The area is estimated at
one million three hundred and eighty thousand seven hundred
acres.</p>

<p>Its surface bears a different aspect from that of the
adjoining parts of America. It is gently undulating, with
hollows filled by numberless little creeks and lakes. The
coasts of these, as well as of the open sea, present a peculiarly
soft and agreeable scenery, as they are skirted by
trees of the most varied foliage.</p>

<p>The climate is less severe than in the adjoining parts of
America; the winter is shorter and milder than in Lower
Canada, and more steady than in Nova Scotia. Its healthfulness
is remarkable, and contributes to an extraordinary
increase of population.</p>

<p><i>Early Settlement.</i>&mdash;This island was necessarily included<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_791" id="Page_791">[Pg 791]</a></span>
in the boundaries of the empire which the French court
claimed in North America, in consequence of the discoveries
of Cartier and Verazzani. It appears to have been
granted, in 1663, to a French captain, the Seuir Doublet,
but held in subordination to a fishing company, established
at the small island of Mexoa. It seems, in fact, to have
been valued only for fishery, and, for this purpose, to have
had some few stations established upon it.</p>

<p><i>Change of Possession.</i>&mdash;After the second reduction of
Louisburg, in 1758, that of Prince Edward again followed,
and it became permanently attached to the British crown.
Its French inhabitants experienced a cruel proscription for
a time. Thousands of peaceable and industrious settlers
were expelled the island, on suspicion of their being concerned
in the murder of some Englishmen, whose scalps
were discovered in the French governor's house. These
were doubtless the fruits of Indian massacres.</p>

<p><i>Plans of Colonization.</i>&mdash;Some years after the island
was confirmed to Britain, Lord Egremont formed a singular
scheme, by which it was to be divided into twelve districts,
ruled by as many barons, each of whom was expected to
erect a castle on his own property, while that nobleman
was to preside as lord paramount. This unwise plan was
changed for another not much preferable. In August, 1767,
a division was made into sixty-seven townships, of about
twenty thousand acres each, which, with some reservations,
were made over to individuals supposed to possess claims
upon the government. They became bound to settle the
country in ten years, to the extent of at least one person
for two hundred acres. The scheme was indifferently carried
into effect.</p>

<p>After the proprietors succeeded in procuring for it a governor
independent of Nova Scotia, Mr. Patterson, appointed
to that office, in 1770, brought back a number of exiled
Acadians, with a view to relieve the effects of the former<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_792" id="Page_792">[Pg 792]</a></span>
cruelty of the government. Tracady was settled by Captain
Macdonald with three hundred Highlanders, and
Chief-baron Montgomery made special efforts to fulfill his
proprietary obligations. From these beginnings the colony
received gradual accessions, and, in 1773, a constitution
being accorded, the first house of assembly was called.</p>

<p>In 1803, the Earl of Selkirk, to whom emigration is so
much indebted, carried over an important colony, consisting
of about eight hundred Highlanders. Such judgment was
shown in his arrangements, that the settlers soon became
very prosperous, and, with the friends who have since
joined them, amounted, before the year 1840, to upwards
of four thousand.</p>

<p><i>Character of the late Governors.</i>&mdash;The governors of late
years have generally well sustained the interests of the colony,
with the exception of one, Mr. Smyth. He succeeded
in 1813, and his violent and tyrannical conduct caused a
general agitation in the colony. He had prevented the
meeting of the house of assembly for several years previous
to 1823, and when a committee of the inhabitants
was appointed to draw up a petition for his removal, he
caused them to be arrested. The high-sheriff, Mr. Stewart,
however, fortunately made his escape to Nova Scotia, and
thence to England. When the true state of things was
made known there, the governor was rëcalled, and Lieutenant-colonel
Ready was appointed his successor. In
1836, Sir John Harvey was appointed governor. He was
highly and justly esteemed for his many good qualities; but
being, in 1837, removed to the government of New Brunswick,
his place was supplied by Sir Charles A. Fitzroy.</p>

<p><i>Inhabitants.</i>&mdash;The inhabitants consist of a few Indians,
about five thousand Acadians, but chiefly of emigrants from
different parts of the empire, particularly from Scotland, the
natives of which constitute more than one-half of the entire
population.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Location</span> and Importance&mdash;Discovery and Settlement&mdash;French Hostilities&mdash;Renewal
of War&mdash;Change of Administration&mdash;Present Condition.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Location and Importance.</i>&mdash;Newfoundland is an island
on the eastern coast of North America, extending farther
out into the Atlantic than any other point of the Western
hemisphere. It is an important and large island, being
about one thousand miles in circuit. Its consequence arises
not from its internal resources, but from its position and its
connection with the cod-fisheries in its vicinity. In this,
its commercial aspect, it is the most valuable of all the
English northern possessions.</p>

<p>The celebrated bank, which constitutes the fishing-ground,
is estimated to extend six hundred miles in length
and two hundred in breadth, composed almost throughout
of masses of solid rock. The abundance of fish is literally
inexhaustible, no diminution of fruitfulness being observed,
although Europe and America have drawn upon this
treasure, to any extent, for several centuries. The vast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_794" id="Page_794">[Pg 794]</a></span>
masses of ice, which float down from the northern seas
into the neighborhood of this island, bring also with them a
valuable article of commerce, viz: herds of seal, which
the seamen contrive to take, and which furnish a rich store
of oil for export.</p>

<p><i>Discovery and Settlement.</i>&mdash;Newfoundland was discovered,
in 1497, by Cabot, and has always been claimed by
Britain. Attention was drawn to its fisheries before 1517;
since, as early as that time, it was stated by the crew of an
English ship, that they had left forty vessels, of different
European nations, engaged in the fishery.</p>

<p>Several partial attempts were made at settling the country,
from 1536 to 1612; but it was only at the latter date
that we find the first attempt made on a large scale to colonize
the territory. It was chiefly promoted by Mr. Guy,
an intelligent merchant of Bristol, who induced a number
of influential men at court to engage in the undertaking.
In 1610, he having been appointed governor of the intended
colony, conveyed thither thirty-nine persons, who constructed
a dwelling and store-house, and formed there the
first permanent settlement.</p>

<p>For several years, however, the spirit of settlement languished.
It was not until 1621 that it began to revive
under the auspices of Sir George Calvert, afterwards Lord
Baltimore, who obtained a grant of a considerable tract on
a part of the island. He had in view the establishment of
a Catholic colony, who might enjoy there the free exercise
of their religion. About twenty years after his first plantation,
there were estimated to be about three hundred and
fifty families on different parts of the coast. The fishery,
at the same time, grew rapidly into importance.</p>

<p>In 1660, the French, who had previously become active
rivals of the British in the fishery, formed a settlement in
the Bay of Placentia, which they occupied for a long period.</p>

<p>Through some jealousy, excited by those who favored
the deep-sea or whale-fishery, in opposition to the boat-fishery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_795" id="Page_795">[Pg 795]</a></span>
at Newfoundland, serious attempts were made at
one time, by the government at home, to break up all the
settlements on the island, and reduce the land to a desert.
This cruel and suicidal policy could, however, be effected
but in part, and some years afterwards more just views
began to be entertained on the subject, and some emigrations
even were made again!</p>

<p><i>French Hostilities.</i>&mdash;During the war with France, which
broke out in consequence of the revolution of 1688, the
settlements in Newfoundland endured great vicissitudes.
The latter had, by favor or oversight, been allowed full
freedom of fishing, and even formed several settlements.
They evidently showed an intention of gaining possession
of the whole island. With a view to effect their object,
the works at Placentia were attacked in 1692, and partly
destroyed; but, in 1696, the French, rëinforced by a squadron
from Europe, attacked St. John, yet without success.
The place, however, suffered severely, and another armament,
before the end of the year, gaining possession of it,
set it on fire. Upon this, Ibberville, with a body of troops,
destroyed all the English stations, except Bonavista and
Carbonier. An English fleet, sent out to retrieve these disasters,
failed through the misconduct of the commander.
The difficulties were terminated in 1698, by the peace of
Ryswick, which placed every thing on the same footing as
before the contest.</p>

<p><i>Renewal of War.</i>&mdash;The war of the succession exposed
the colony again to the attacks of the French, who were
favored by local situation in their proceedings at Newfoundland.
The English, at first, took some of the smaller settlements;
but in 1705, the troops in Placentia, rëinforced
by five hundred men from Canada, successfully attacked
the British colonists. Three years afterwards, St. John
was completely destroyed, and the French became masters
of every English station, except Carbonier. A subsequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_796" id="Page_796">[Pg 796]</a></span>
attempt of the British to recover their possessions, was not
without effect; but their splendid successes in Europe
enabled them at the treaty of Utrecht, in 1713, to do more
than redeem all their losses in America. Louis XIV. was
compelled to yield up all his possessions on the coast of
Newfoundland; but he retained, for his subjects, the right
to erect huts and stages for fishing on particular portions
of the coast.</p>

<p><i>Changes of Administration.</i>&mdash;The nominal dependence
of Newfoundland on Nova Scotia, was withdrawn in 1779.
From this period until 1827, the government of the island
was administered by naval commanders, appointed to
cruise on the fishing station, but who returned to England
during the winter. Since the last-named period, the government
has been administered by resident governors, and,
in 1832, it was determined to grant the boon of a representative
assembly. This was placed on an extremely
liberal footing, the assembly being elected by a suffrage
nearly universal.</p>

<p><i>Present Condition.</i>&mdash;The chief British settlements are
on the large peninsula named Avalon, constituting the
south-eastern part of the island, St. John, the capital, is
very convenient for ships coming either from Europe or
America, and particularly for the deep-sea and seal-fisheries.
After all its improvements, it still bears the aspect
of a fishing station, consisting of one long and narrow
street, extending entirely along the sea.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Extent</span>&mdash;Discovery&mdash;Settlement&mdash;Contests with France&mdash;Present State.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Extent.</i>&mdash;The Hudson's Bay Territory is a region of
British America, far surpassing, in extent, the settled and
occupied parts. It is about two thousand six hundred miles
in length, from east to west, and nearly one thousand five
hundred miles in width, from south to north. It extends
northerly till it reaches the Arctic ocean.</p>

<p><i>Discovery.</i>&mdash;Hudson's bay, from which the territory
takes its name, was repeatedly visited, at an early period,
by English navigators, though for a long time solely with a
view to the great object of discovering a north-west passage
to Asia. It appears that Sebastian Cabot, in 1517, first
penetrated to this gulf, but did not view it as an inclosed
sea. This voyage, however, was lost sight of, so that
when Hudson, in 1610, sailed through the straits now bearing
his name, and found a wide and open expanse, it was
considered a new discovery, and named, from him, the
Hudson sea. Nor was it recognized as a bay, but was
viewed, with hope, as a part of the Pacific. The great
navigator, however, having been compelled to winter
within the straits, where the crew were exposed to severe
suffering, a violent mutiny arose among them, when he and
several of his adherents were exposed, in a small boat, on
this inhospitable shore, and doubtless perished.</p>

<p>Several voyages were made during the next half century,
with many perils and disasters, and all of them abortive as
to the primary object. But they were the means of laying
open the great extent of Hudson's bay, and of conveying
some idea of the valuable furs which might be obtained on
its shores.</p>

<p><i>Settlements.</i>&mdash;A Frenchman, named Grosseliez, having
penetrated thither from Canada, made a survey of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_798" id="Page_798">[Pg 798]</a></span>
country, and laid before the French court the plan of a
settlement. Finding his proposition unheeded, he sought
the English patronage under Prince Rupert, and in June,
1668, a company of adventurers sailed in a vessel commanded
by Zachariah Gillam, and reached a river, then
called Nemisco, to which they gave the name of Rupert.
Here they wintered with comparative comfort. Upon the
report made by this party, a capital of ten thousand five
hundred pounds was subscribed by the prince and others,
and a charter was obtained, securing to them the exclusive
trade and administration of all the countries around Hudson's
bay. They immediately sent out adventurers, who
formed a settlement on Rupert's river. Others were
established on Moose river, in 1674, and four years later
on the Albany. By 1685, they had added two more on the
Nelson and Severn, and in 1690, their affairs were in such
a flourishing condition, that they determined to triple their
original stock.</p>

<p><i>Contests with France.</i>&mdash;France, learning these results,
regretted her indifference to the proposal of Grosseliez,
and commenced efforts to secure advantages which she
had, in effect, thrown away. "A claim was advanced on
the ground of prior occupation, and Grosseliez, already
detached from the English service, was sent out, in 1682,
with another officer. He not only laid the foundation of a
factory on Hayes' river, but, in the following spring, surprised
the British one on the Nelson, taking Gillam a prisoner,
and carrying him to Canada; and yet, soon after, by
means not very distinctly stated, the English became masters
of these stations. In 1686, however, amid a profound
peace, the Chevalier de Troyes marched thither, and suddenly
took the Rupert, Hayes, and Albany factories.
These movements do not seem to have attracted much
attention in Europe, but when the war in 1688 broke out,
hostile operations were carried on with great ardor. During
1693-94-95, the different posts were successively taken and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_799" id="Page_799">[Pg 799]</a></span>
rëtaken. In 1696, the English had recovered almost the
whole; but in the following year, a squadron from France
defeated the Hudson's bay ships, and took all the forts
except Albany. The treaty of Ryswick leaving things <i>in
statu quo</i>, this state of possession continued till the peace of
Utrecht, in 1713, by which the various posts were restored
to Britain."</p>

<p>Discoveries have been made in the intervening years,
from the above date to the present time, which have
resulted in a more extensive knowledge of this immense
country. Settlements have occasionally been made on the
coasts of the bays or rivers which so abound there; but
the object principally in view of the many expeditions on
those northern waters&mdash;viz: the ascertaining of a passage
into the Pacific at the head of the American continent&mdash;has
never been secured.</p>

<h2><a name="RUSSIAN_AMERICA" id="RUSSIAN_AMERICA">RUSSIAN AMERICA.</a></h2>

<p>GENERAL DESCRIPTION.</p>



<p>The Russians may be regarded as the first discoverers
of the north-western shores of this continent. Behring
and Tchirikow, in 1728, first saw the straits which separate
America and Asia. The Russian voyagers subsequently
extended their discoveries southwardly, along the American
coast towards Nootka Sound, and, at a late period, made a
few establishments for hunting and trade with the Indians
on the coast. A single settlement at Sitka, and two others
at Kodiak, and Illuluk, on an adjacent island, engaged in
the fur-trade with the Indians, comprise all the actual Russian
possessions in America.</p>

<p>The limits of the Russian territory, in this region, are
bounded on the south by the parallel of fifty-four degrees
and forty minutes north latitude; but though the Muscovite
power lays claim to the territory, and about fifty thousand
Indians acknowledge his authority, the sovereignty is little
more than a name. On the 5th of April, 1824, a convention
between the United States and his majesty the Emperor
of all the Russias, was concluded and signed at St.
Petersburg. By the third article of this convention it was
agreed, "that hereafter there should not be formed under
the authority of said states any establishment upon the
northern coast of America, nor in any of the islands adjacent,
to the north of fifty-four degrees and forty minutes of
north latitude; and that, in the same manner, there shall
be none formed by Russian subjects, or under the authority
of Russia, south of the same parallel."</p>

<p>This coast possesses an Alpine character. In some parts
it rises into mountains covered with snow, with immense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_801" id="Page_801">[Pg 801]</a></span>
glaciers winding through its cavities. The most remarkable
summit seems to be that called St. Elias by the Russian
navigators, and which, it is affirmed, has been visible at sea
at the distance of sixty leagues.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of the more northern regions of this coast,
appear to be Esquimaux, as they abound also on the eastern
coast, and around Hudson's bay. The savages of Nootka
are said to be very cruel to the captives taken in war, and
have frequently proved treacherous and vindictive in the
intercourse held with trading-vessels.</p>

<p>The northern coast of Yucatan was first visited and
explored in 1517 by Francisco Fernandez de Cordova, who
sailed from Cuba in three small vessels, with a company of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_803" id="Page_803">[Pg 803]</a></span>
adventurers. He here found a race of men much bolder
and more warlike than the inhabitants of the islands, who
resisted the intruders with a most determined spirit. Many
of the latter perished in the contests they were engaged in
and Cordova himself received a wound, of which he died
soon after his return to Cuba.</p>

<p>The prospect of booty which the region presented, stimulated
the Spaniards to secure their prize at any hazard.
Another expedition was planned the following year, under
Grijalva, consisting of four ships and two hundred and forty
men. They commenced by verifying the reports of the
preceding adventurers; they then continued their voyage
as far as the River Panuco, and were met every where
with the marks of a good degree of civilization. Landing
frequently, they were sometimes suspected, and warmly
attacked; at other times, they were received with the reverence
due to superior natures.</p>

<p><i>Condition, anterior to the Spanish Conquest.</i>&mdash;The most
ancient Mexican nation, according to tradition, was the
Toltecas. It would appear that, at a period corresponding
with that of 472 of the Christian era, they were expelled
from their own country, called Tollan, somewhere north
of Mexico, whence becoming migratory for many years,
they at length built a city, called Tolton, fifty miles east
from Mexico.</p>

<p>In 667, the Toltecas were chiefly cut off by famine and
pestilence. About a hundred years after this, their country
was occupied by the Checkemecas, who likewise emigrated
from some northern section of the continent. They mingled
and intermarried with the remnant of the Toltecas. In 1160,
the Aztecs, who dwelt north of the Gulf of California,
abandoned their country, and, for a series of years, led a
wandering life. They originally consisted of six tribes, but
eventually the Mexican tribes separated from the rest, and
continued their journey alone. In 1325, they reached a
spot on which they commenced a city, and which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_804" id="Page_804">[Pg 804]</a></span>
called Mexico, after Mexitli, their god of war. Here, for
two hundred years, down to the time of their conquest by
the Spaniards, they flourished. They increased in power
and wealth. They were joined by the other Aztec tribes
from whom they had separated. They were a superior
people&mdash;well instructed in the art of war. They excelled
in sculpture, and, at the time of the invasion, had made
considerable progress in architecture, agriculture, &amp;c.
Their capital contained not less than one hundred thousand
inhabitants. Their government was an elective monarchy.
Montezuma was on the Mexican throne, and had surrounded
himself with the highest regal splendor, and exercised the
most despotic power. Such, in brief, was the condition of
the Mexicans when their conquest was attempted by the
Spaniards.</p>

<p><i>Invasion by Cortez.</i>&mdash;The reports which had been brought
home by several, especially Grijalva, of the fertility and
wealth of Mexico, determined Velasquez, the governor of
Cuba, to attempt its conquest. The expedition was intrusted
to Fernando Cortez, a man peculiarly well calculated by his
courage, his perseverance, and other qualities, for an enterprise
like this, full of danger and difficulty. The expedition
consisted of eleven vessels and six hundred and seventeen
men. The object was to make war upon a monarch whose
dominions were more extensive than all the kingdoms subject
to the Spanish crown. Arriving at the island of Cozumel,
Cortez had there the good fortune to redeem Aguilar,
a Spaniard, who had been eight years a prisoner among the
Indians, and who proved extremely useful as an interpreter.
In March, 1519, Cortez landed in Tabasco, a southern
province of Mexico, where, though the Indians met him
with extraordinary courage, they were routed with great
slaughter, in several successive engagements.</p>

<p>Continuing his course to the westward, he landed at San
Juan d'Ulloa. Here he was most respectfully addressed by
a deputation on board of his ship, but in a language altogether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_805" id="Page_805">[Pg 805]</a></span>
unknown to him, and even to Aguilar. Fortunately,
one of his female slaves, received at Tabasco, well understood
the Mexican language, and explained what had been
said in the Yucatan tongue, with which Aguilar was unacquainted.
This woman, who was known afterwards by the
name of Donna Marina, informed him that the persons who
addressed him were the officers of a great monarch, whom
they called Montezuma, and that they were sent to inquire
what his intentions were in visiting their coast, and to offer
any assistance he might need in order to continue his voyage.
Cortez, having thus learned the purport of the message,
assured the officers that he approached their country
with the most friendly sentiments, and came to propose
matters of great moment to their prince, which should soon
be more fully unfolded. Next morning he landed his men,
horses, and artillery, by the assistance of the natives, who
unconsciously were admitting among them the instruments
of their own destruction.</p>

   <p class="caption2">Marina interpreting the Address of the Mexican Deputation.</p>
</div>

<p>On the 26th of March, Cortez commenced his march
towards the Mexican capital, having first destroyed his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_806" id="Page_806">[Pg 806]</a></span>
vessels, that his soldiers, deprived of the means of retreat,
might rely solely on their valor. On his way thither, by
consummate address, he alienated from Montezuma several
of the petty states with their caziques. Others he compelled,
by force of arms, to join him. By degrees, he
marched into the country, and, with the addition of the
natives, he found himself at the head of an army consisting
of several thousand persons.</p>

   <p class="caption2">Cortez burning his Ships.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Arrival of Cortez in the Mexican Capital.</i>&mdash;As Cortez
approached the Mexican capital, a great retinue of persons
came to meet him, adorned with plumes and clad in mantles
of fine cotton. Each of these saluted Cortez in the
most respectful manner. They announced the approach
of Montezuma himself; and soon after, the harbingers, two
hundred in number, in a uniform dress, appeared in sight.
These were followed by a company of higher rank, in
splendid apparel, in the midst of whom was Montezuma,
carried in a litter richly ornamented with gold and feathers
of various colors. The king and Cortez met, and the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_807" id="Page_807">[Pg 807]</a></span>
respectful salutations passed between them. Montezuma
conducted Cortez to the quarters that had been prepared
for his reception, and took leave of him, saying, "You are
now with your brothers in your own house; refresh yourselves
after your fatigue, and be happy until I return."</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="illus-810.jpg" id="illus-810.jpg"></a>
   <img src="images/illus-810.jpg" alt="Meeting of Montezuma and Cortez." title="Meeting of Montezuma and Cortez."/>
   <p class="caption2">Meeting of Montezuma and Cortez.</p>
</div>

<p>The first care of Cortez, however, was to take precautions
for his security, by planting the artillery so as to command
the different avenues which led to the place allotted
for his reception.</p>

<p>In the evening, Montezuma returned to visit his guests,
and again made them magnificent presents. Various conferences
passed between them; and the next day Cortez
and some of his principal attendants were admitted to an
audience of the emperor.</p>

<p>While these events were happening, Cortez formed a plan
no less extraordinary than daring. This was to seize Montezuma
in his palace, and to carry him prisoner to the
Spanish quarters. He communicated his plan to his principal
officers, and almost instantly put it into execution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_808" id="Page_808">[Pg 808]</a></span></p>

   <p class="caption2">Montezuma on his Throne.</p>
</div>

<p><i>The Abdication of Montezuma.</i>&mdash;Although Montezuma
was permitted to exercise the functions of royalty, yet he
was guarded with the utmost vigilance by the Spaniards.
The king's brave son, with several of the principal officers,
on the slightest pretext, was burned alive by the command
of Cortez. The monarch himself was, at length, bound
with fetters. Having both the monarch and his subjects
under this temporary authority, Cortez availed himself of
it to the utmost. He appointed commissioners to survey
the empire, and to prepare the minds of the people for
submitting to the Spaniards; and, in the end, he persuaded
Montezuma to acknowledge himself a vassal to the Spanish
crown, and to pay an annual tribute. The fallen prince,
at the instance of Cortez, accompanied this profession of
fealty and homage, with a magnificent present to the king
of Spain, and, after his example, his subjects brought in
liberal contributions.</p>

<p><i>War, and the Death of Montezuma.</i>&mdash;About this time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_809" id="Page_809">[Pg 809]</a></span>
Velasquez, piqued by the success of his subaltern, had sent
a force into Mexico to take him and his principal officers
prisoners; but the good fortune of Cortez triumphed again;
for overcoming his enemies in battle, he induced the greater
part of them to join his standard; and when he had least of
all expected it, he was placed at the head of a thousand
Spaniards, ready to aid him, at any hazard, in his enterprises.</p>

<p>This additional force had but just time to enroll themselves
under their new leader, before the Mexicans attacked
them in all directions.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="illus-812.jpg" id="illus-812.jpg"></a>
   <img src="images/illus-812.jpg" alt="Death of Montezuma." title="Death of Montezuma."/>
   <p class="caption2">Death of Montezuma.</p>
</div>

<p>Cortez now found himself environed with the most imminent
dangers. The only resource which remained to him
was to try what effect the interposition of Montezuma
might have upon his enraged subjects. When, the next
morning, they approached to renew the assault, that unfortunate
prince was compelled to advance to the battlements,
and exhort his people to discontinue hostilities. But the
fury of the multitude could not be repressed, and it was
now directed momentarily against their prince. Flights of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_810" id="Page_810">[Pg 810]</a></span>
arrows and volleys of stones poured in so violently upon the
ramparts, that before the Spanish soldiers had time to lift
their shields for Montezuma's defence, two arrows wounded
the unhappy monarch, and a blow of a stone on his temple
struck him to the ground.</p>

<p>Most bitterly did these poor men lament the consequences
of their displeasure, as they witnessed the fate of their sovereign.
As for Montezuma, in a paroxysm of rage he tore
the bandage from his wounds, and so obstinately refused to
take any nourishment, that he soon ended his days, rejecting
with disdain all the urgency of the Spaniards that he should
embrace the Christian faith.</p>

<p><i>Retreat and Return of Cortez.</i>&mdash;The death of Montezuma
filled the Mexicans with surprise and terror; but
added to, rather than diminished, their hostility. They
determined to reduce by famine a foe which they could not
subdue by force. This coming to the knowledge of Cortez,
he perceived, situated as he was, that his safety lay in
instant retreat from the city. Preparations were accordingly
made to march out of Mexico that very night. Each
soldier took such booty as he was able; yet a large quantity
of silver was left behind. At midnight, the troops abandoned
their quarters, and proceeded in silence along the
causeway that led to Tacubaya.</p>

<p>The Mexicans were watching the retreating foe. At
length, the latter reached a breach which had been made in
the causeway, when in an instant they were astounded
by a tremendous roar of martial instruments. Clouds of
arrows were showered upon them. Yet they struggled on
to a second breach, where they were obliged to wade
through the mud and water. All was darkness, confusion,
dismay. Many were so heavily laden with spoils, that they
sunk to rise no more. The carnage was dreadful. It was
a night of blood&mdash;or what is known in the Mexican history
as the <i>Noche triste</i>, or "doleful night." Cortez lost some
five or six hundred Spaniards, and of his allies, the Tlascalans,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_811" id="Page_811">[Pg 811]</a></span>
above two thousand. Only a small portion of the
pillaged treasures was saved&mdash;horses, ammunition, baggage,
nearly all were gone. In the morning, although his troops
needed rest and his wounded care, Cortez pursued his
march towards Tlascala, where he was received with kindness
by his allies.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

   <img src="images/illus-814.jpg" alt="Noche Triste." title="Noche Triste."/>
   <p class="caption2">Noche Triste.</p>
</div>

<p>Some interval of tranquillity was now absolutely necessary,
not only that the Spaniards might give attention to
the cure of their wounds, but in order to recruit their
strength, exhausted by a long succession of fatigues and
hardships. When these objects had been attained, and his
forces were considerably augmented, on the 28th of December,
1520, Cortez commenced his return towards Mexico.</p>

<p>In his progress towards it, he took possession of Tezcuco,
the second town in the empire, situated on the lake about
twenty miles from the capital. He had already prepared
the materials for building several brigantines, so that they
might be carried thither in pieces ready to be put together,
and launched when they were needed. Here he established<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_812" id="Page_812">[Pg 812]</a></span>
his head-quarters, as it was the most suitable place to launch
the brigantines. With the launching of these, all was in
readiness for the great enterprise.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >

   <p class="caption2">Cortez building Brigantines on the Lakes.</p>
</div>

<p>Nor were the Mexicans unprepared. Upon the death of
Montezuma, his brother, Quetlavaca, a man distinguished
for his courage and capacity, was raised to the throne.
But in the midst of his preparations to meet the invaders,
he was fatally attacked by the small-pox, a scourge which
had been introduced into the country by the Spaniards.
Gautimozin, nephew and son-in-law of Montezuma, was
next chosen emperor, nor could the choice have fallen on a
more deserving man.</p>

<p>Great bravery was displayed by the Mexicans during the
siege. Cortez found it necessary to proceed with caution
in all his measures. His chief prospect of success lay in
cutting off supplies from the city; at length, in that, he
succeeded, so that the public stores were exhausted, and
the sufferings in the city became extreme.</p>

<p><i>Fall of the City and Empire.</i>&mdash;At this crisis, Gautimozin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_813" id="Page_813">[Pg 813]</a></span>
in an attempt to escape to the provinces, with a view to
arouse his people more effectually for his defence, was captured
and conducted to Cortez.</p>

<p>He appeared with singular composure and self-respect,
requesting of Cortez, that no insult should be offered to the
empress or his children. "I have done," said he to his conqueror,
"what became a monarch. I have defended my
people to the last extremity. Nothing now remains but to
die. Take this dagger," (laying hold of one which Cortez
wore,) "plant it in my heart, and put an end to a life which
can be no longer useful to my country." Before he left the
city, he had been careful to disappoint the expectations of
the Spaniards, by throwing all his treasures into the lake.</p>

<p>When the fate of their sovereign was known, the Mexicans
laid down their arms, and Cortez took possession of
that small part of the capital which yet remained, three-fourths
of it having been reduced to ashes during the conflict.
In this manner terminated the memorable siege of
Mexico.</p>

<p>The fate of the capital decided that, also, of the empire.
The provinces submitted, one after another, to the conquerors.
Small parties of Spaniards, marching through
them without interruption, penetrated in different quarters
to the Pacific ocean. Thus a great and rich empire was
secured to Spain, through the almost incredible efforts of a
single man at the head of a small band of adventurers.</p>

<p><i>Fate of Cortez.</i>&mdash;As a reward for his bold and surprising
achievements, Cortez was warmly eulogized by his countrymen
at home, and the Emperor Charles V. appointed
him captain-general and governor of New Spain, with other
tokens of favor. But a bitter cup was at last pressed to his
lips. After returning to America, and continuing there for a
time in his command, he came back, in 1540, to his native
country. But in consequence of his ambition and usurpations,
his reception at home was ill-suited to the character
of his heroic deeds. "The emperor behaved to him with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_814" id="Page_814">[Pg 814]</a></span>
cold civility, his ministers treated him sometimes with neglect,
sometimes with insolence. His grievances received
no redress; his claims were urged without effect; and, after
several years spent in fruitless application to ministers and
judges, he ended his days on the 2d of December, in the
sixty-second year of his age."</p>

<p><i>Extent of New Spain.</i>&mdash;This country, under the Spaniards,
embraced a more extensive region than the empire of
Mexico, or the dominions of Montezuma and his predecessors.
It included, in addition to the Mexican empire
proper, New Navarre, a vast territory, extending to the
north and west; the provinces of California, as also the
peninsula of California; and, moreover, the provinces of
Yucatan and Honduras, stretching from the Bay of Campeachy
to beyond Cape Gracias a Dios. At an early
period, most of these countries had been visited and subjugated
by Spanish adventurers. The peninsula of California,
which had been discovered by Cortez in 1536, began to be
explored by the Jesuits towards the close of the seventeenth
century. Here they established an important mission,
but, after a time, were expelled from the country.</p>

<p><i>Introduction of the Catholic Religion.</i>&mdash;The conquerors
of New Spain carried with them the Catholic faith, which
became the established religion; and, indeed, was the only
religion that was tolerated, until the revolution in the
beginning of the present century. The establishment was
instituted as an auxiliary branch of the government, on a
similar model to that in Spain. In attempts to convert the
natives, they made use of the same unjustifiable means that
have been resorted to by the Jesuits. But notwithstanding
all that was done, their spiritual character and condition were
unchanged. Of real Christianity, they remained wholly
ignorant, and retained all their veneration for their ancient
superstitions. This mixture of Christianity with their own
heathenish rites and notions, was transmitted to their posterity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_815" id="Page_815">[Pg 815]</a></span>
and has never been eradicated. That device of the
infernal pit, the Inquisition, was established in America by
the bigoted zeal of Philip II., in the year 1570. This
measure completed the ecclesiastical apparatus for fastening
Catholicism on the new world.</p>

<p><i>Native Spanish Population under the Colonial Government.</i>&mdash;For
nearly three centuries, down to the year 1810,
Mexico was governed by viceroys, appointed by the court
of Spain, all of whom, with one exception, were European
Spaniards. Every situation in the gift of the crown was
bestowed upon a European, nor is there an instance, for
many years before the revolution, either in the church, the
army, or the law, in which the door of preferment was
opened to a Spaniard, Mexican-born. Through this policy,
a privileged <i>caste</i> arose, distinct from the Mexican Spaniards
in feelings, habits, and interests&mdash;the paid agents
of a government whose only aim was to enrich itself,
without any regard to the abuses perpetrated under its
authority.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_816" id="Page_816">[Pg 816]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Classes of the Inhabitants.</i>&mdash;Anterior to the revolution in
1810, the population of Mexico was divided into distinct
castes, as follows: 1, The old Spaniards, born in Spain,
designated <i>Chapetones</i>. 2, <i>Creoles</i> or Whites, of pure
European race, born in America, and regarded by the first
class as natives. 3, The <i>Indians</i>, or indigenous copper-colored
race. 4, The <i>Mestizos</i>, or mongrel breeds of
Whites and Indians, in the purer descent approaching to
the Creoles. 5, <i>Mulattoes</i>, or descendants of Whites and
Negroes. 6, The <i>Zambos</i>, descendants of Negroes and
Indians. And 7, The <i>African Negroes</i>, whether manumitted
or slaves.</p>

<p>The pure races were the old Spaniards, Creoles, Indians,
and Negroes, and gave rise, in their various combinations
or divisions, to the others. The remaining three races
were impure or mixed, and were sub-divided, without any
assigned limits. Upon the breaking out of the revolution,
the distinctions of caste were all absorbed in the name of
Americans and Europeans.</p>

<p><i>Causes of the First Mexican Revolution.</i>&mdash;For more than
a century, Spain had been on the decline, when, in 1808, the
Emperor Napoleon gave a finishing stroke to her degradation,
by seizing upon the royal family, and placing his brother
Jerome upon the throne. To this revolution, the Spanish
chiefs, who were assured of their places, were disposed to
yield, excepting the viceroy of Mexico. But the <i>people</i>,
indignant at the foul treatment which their sovereign had
received, were determined not to submit to it. A general
revolt against the authority of Buonaparte, soon disclosed
itself in old Spain, intelligence of which reaching Mexico
on the 29th of July, 1808, the feelings of the people were
excited to the highest pitch of enthusiasm. At this time,
the Cabildo, or municipality of Mexico, presented a petition
to Iturrigaray the viceroy, to assemble a junta, or representatives
of the province, for self-government. The viceroy,
however, hesitated, fearing the Spanish population, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_817" id="Page_817">[Pg 817]</a></span>
opposed the measure. Apprised of his inclination to gratify
the people, the Spaniards seized the viceroy, and delivered
him over to the prison of the Inquisition. The conspirators
were principally Spanish merchants in Mexico, and were
secretly favored in their designs by the court of the Audiciencia,
the highest judicial tribunal of Mexico.</p>

<p>The European Spaniards, both in the capital and in the
interior, now formed patriotic associations for the defence
of what they termed their rights, and armed themselves
against the Creoles, who had favored the project of assembling
the junta. The latter, though by far the most numerous,
were unused to arms, and submitted for the moment; but
their spirit was aroused, and it became an absorbing question
whether themselves or the small clique of Europeans
should possess the right of administering the government
during the captivity of their king. A general impatience
to shake off the yoke of foreign domination, began to seize
the minds of all. There was wanting only a leader to make
the occasion and to strike the blow.</p>

<p><i>Commencement of the Revolution.</i>&mdash;The person was soon
found, in Don Miguel Hidalgo Castilla, a clergyman, distinguished
for his talents, learning, and liberality of sentiment.
Perceiving the general disaffection of the people,
and the prevailing animosities against the Spaniards, as
also having private motives of discontent, Hidalgo conceived
the plan of a general insurrection for the subversion
of the colonial government.</p>

<p>Allende, a friend of Hidalgo, was the first to raise the
standard of revolt in the little town of Dolores, on the 16th
of September, 1810, where he seized and imprisoned seven
Europeans, whose property he distributed among his followers.
The Indians, under Hidalgo, now flew to arms; and
being rëinforced by disaffected troops belonging to the
government, Hidalgo marched to Guanaxuato, a wealthy
town of eighty thousand inhabitants, of which, after a strenuous
contest, he received the submission. This was an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_818" id="Page_818">[Pg 818]</a></span>
acquisition of signal importance, as he found in the treasury
an amount of five millions of silver.</p>

<p>From this period, the insurrection spread rapidly, notwithstanding
the efforts of Venegas, the new viceroy, to
allay it. Many towns declared in favor of Hidalgo, who
proceeded from Guanaxuato to Valladolid, where he was
joyfully received as a deliverer. His pecuniary resources
were increased by the donation of one million two hundred
thousand dollars from the public authorities. His next step
was to march towards the capital. He had made a great
acquisition in having Morelos, a warlike priest, and highly
celebrated in the revolution, come to his aid.</p>

<p>Mexico was, at this time, in a highly critical condition&mdash;the
prevailing disaffection had reached it, and was producing
its fruits of weakness and division. The forces collected for
its defence were wholly inadequate to the object.</p>

<p>In this juncture of affairs, Hidalgo might doubtless have
seized on the capital; indeed, many were anxiously awaiting
his approach, as its deliverer. After an anxious night, great
was the surprise the next morning, on the part of the people,
when they saw the assailants retiring. The cause of
Hidalgo's strange retrograde movement has never been
satisfactorily ascertained.</p>

<p>From this period, sad reverses awaited him. When he
had arrived at Aculco, on his retreat, he was attacked, on
the 7th of November, by Calleja, who, with the main part
of the Spanish army, had previously reached the capital.
Of the royal troops, six thousand were disciplined veterans,
and their imposing appearance alone was sufficient to
frighten Hidalgo's Indians. These fled at the first fire; the
regular troops being thus left unsupported, were unable
long to stand the attack. Pursued by the royalists with
great fury, the slaughter became immense; ten thousand
of the independents, in the official report of Calleja, were
said to have been killed, wounded, and taken prisoners.
Hidalgo, having retreated to Guanaxuato, was, on the 29th
of November, attacked again by Calleja, and driven from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_819" id="Page_819">[Pg 819]</a></span>
his position, with the loss of twenty-five pieces of cannon
and several valuable officers.</p>

<p>"Hidalgo retreated to Valladolid, where he caused eighty
Europeans to be beheaded, and proceeded thence to Guadalaxara;
he made another triumphal entrance into that
city, on the 24th of November. Here he committed
another act of cold-blooded massacre, which has left a foul
blot on his name. All the Europeans having been thrown
into prison, Hidalgo determined to destroy them. Without
trial or previous examination, they were taken out in small
parties, and conducted under the veil of night to retired
parts of the neighboring mountains, where between seven
and eight hundred were butchered in secret. This remorseless
act of barbarity, besides being wholly unjustifiable by
the rules of war, was impolitic in the extreme. It prevented
many respectable Creoles from joining the insurgents;
and as it drove the Spaniards to despair, it furnished
them at the same time with an excuse for any atrocities
which they chose to commit."</p>

<p>Hidalgo continued to retreat towards Saltillo. By this
time, his forces were reduced to about four thousand men;
and arriving at Saltillo, a distance of nearly five hundred
miles from the Mexican capital, he left the army, and with
several officers sought the frontiers of the United States,
with the intention of purchasing arms and military stores.
He was destined, however, to be the victim of treachery.
One of his subordinates in office had the baseness to arrest
him, for the purpose of securing a pardon for himself. The
leader, unsuspicious of danger when attacked, was easily
overcome and taken. It was on the 21st of March, 1811,
that Hidalgo and his followers were made prisoners.
Many of them were executed on the field of action the
next day. Hidalgo and a few others were not put to death
until the 27th of July following.</p>

<p><i>Continuation of the War by the Patriot Chiefs.</i>&mdash;The
revolution had evidently taken deep hold on the minds of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_820" id="Page_820">[Pg 820]</a></span>
the people. The fate of Hidalgo did not dispirit the chiefs
of the patriot cause. The prominent of these, Rayon, a
lawyer, Villagran, and Morelos, a priest, now assumed the
responsibility of directing the storm. The principal of
these was Morelos, and to an account of his movements
we confine ourselves.</p>

<p>From small beginnings Morelos possessed, at length, an
efficient army, and was obeyed throughout nearly the entire
southern coast of Mexico. On taking the field, town after
town was taken, and victory succeeded to victory. His
course, moreover, was marked by the humane treatment of
his prisoners in every instance. Morelos had now great
reason to hope for success in his noble enterprise, while the
inhabitants were ready to aid him in every possible way.
In this state, it was deemed necessary to oppose to him
the greatest captain of the governmental forces, and Calleja
was summoned to defend the capital.</p>

<p>Calleja, soon after his arrival at Mexico, attacked the
army of Morelos at Quantla; but after a severe action, he
was repulsed, and obliged to retreat, leaving five hundred
dead on the field of battle. But what he could not effect
by storm, he now attempted to accomplish by siege. For
seventy-five days he continued to besiege Morelos, who
was determined, if possible, to hold out; but all hopes of
obtaining provisions being, at length, extinguished, Morelos
resolved to evacuate the place, which he effected on the
night of the 2d of May, 1811. Most of the inhabitants
marched out with the army. When Calleja discovered the
movement, he commenced a spirited attack upon them, and
four thousand of the patriots were slain. It was during the
events attending the siege of Quantla, that Victoria and
Bravo, both young men, began to distinguish themselves in
the cause of independence. Guerréro likewise, in the successful
defence of a neighboring town, began his long and
perilous career.</p>

<p>Following the affair at Quantla, Morelos engaged in
numerous encounters with divisions of the enemy, and, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_821" id="Page_821">[Pg 821]</a></span>
a time, was victorious; but he was at length taken, and
doomed to execution. Just prior to his death, he uttered
the following simple, but affecting prayer: 'Lord, if I have
done well, thou knowest it; if ill, to thy infinite mercy I
commend my soul.' He then bound a handkerchief over
his eyes, gave the signal to the soldiers to fire, and met
death with as much composure as he had ever shown when
facing it on the field of battle.</p>

<p><i>Decline of the Revolution.</i>&mdash;After the death of Morelos,
no leader was found whose influence was sufficient to combine
the efforts of the insurgents, and secure harmony
among the chiefs. The cause of the revolution, therefore,
declined apace. Teran, Guerréro, Rayon, Torrés, Bravo,
and Victoria, commanding in different parts of the country,
were mostly, in the course of two or three years, overcome,
and taken prisoners. The story of Victoria is one of
uncommon interest. The province of Vera Cruz was the
field of his operations, and it was not until after a struggle
of two years, that this formidable insurgent chief was disarmed
of his power to harass the viceroy, Apadoca. He
lost many of his followers in battle, others deserted him,
and he was left, in the end, literally alone. No threats and
no promises of preferment could induce him to offer his
submission to the government. Unattended by a single
friend, he sought the solitude and security of the mountains,
and was lost for several years to his country.</p>

<p><i>Invasion of Mexico by Mina.</i>&mdash;In the year 1817, when
most of the insurgent forces were dispersed, an enterprise
of singular boldness was attempted in Mexico, by a foreigner
named Don Xavier Mina. His more specific object
was to establish the independence of Mexico on a constitutional
basis, without an entire severance of the country
from Spain. Mina was a nephew of the celebrated general
of that name, who so long resisted the French and
Spanish royalists in his native country. In May, 1816,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_822" id="Page_822">[Pg 822]</a></span>
he sailed from Liverpool with a small expedition, having a
few thousand stand of arms, and also equipages for a body
of infantry and cavalry, and arrived in the United States
in June. Here he procured the service of several officers,
an addition of muskets, and some pecuniary aid from Baltimore
and New Orleans. Sailing for the Gulf of Mexico,
he did not reach Galveston until November, where he was
joined by Aury, the commander of the privateers in that
quarter, and by some of the inhabitants; but as it was too
late for operations, he passed the winter in Galveston.</p>

<p>Early in the following spring, Mina entered upon the
prosecution of his design. But the time chosen by him
was unpropitious. The revolutionary cause had fallen to a
low point. Mina failed, was taken, and shot. The power
of the insurgents was broken, and most of their eminent
men were either killed in battle, or shot as traitors, or imprisoned.
But the principles of independence were daily gaining
ground in the country at large, and the spirit of the
revolutionists, though checked for a time, was not subdued,
as was proved by subsequent events in Mexican history.</p>

<p><i>Revolution under Iturbide.</i>&mdash;The unfortunate termination
of the expedition under Mina, was by no means a termination
of the difficulties in which Mexico had long been
involved. The next person who largely figured in her
affairs was Augustin Iturbide, who had risen, in 1816, by
his valor and capacity, to the command of what was called
the northern army. In 1820, the cortes having ordered
the sale of the church property, the viceroy, Apadoca,
refused to acknowledge the cortes; he employed Iturbide
to reduce Guerréro, one of the patriot chiefs; but, instead
of this, he formed a junction with that chief, and on February
24th, 1821, he proclaimed the independence of his
country. Soon after, he took possession of the capital, and,
in 1822, May 18th, he usurped the crown, through the subserviency
of his troops. He was proclaimed emperor,
under the name of Augustin the First.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_823" id="Page_823">[Pg 823]</a></span></p>

<p>The next morning congress was convened in extraordinary
session. His election to the imperial dignity was
proposed and discussed in his presence, and was voted for
by a few more than one-half the whole body of delegates.
Meanwhile, the friends of liberal institutions, overawed by
the power of the usurper, fled to their wonted retreats, until
a fitting season should arrive for acting with union and efficiency.
The acts of oppression of Iturbide, from this time,
continued to increase. He ordered the dissolution of congress,
had recourse to forced loans, with other usurpations.</p>

<p>While affairs were in this posture, Santa Anna, who at
this time was commanding at Vera Cruz, was suddenly
dismissed. Surprised at treatment thus harsh, and as he
deemed unjust, Santa Anna excited the garrison to revolt,
for the purpose of dethroning Iturbide, and establishing a
republican government. While these matters were in progress,
Victoria, who for some years had lived in obscurity,
made his appearance, and was appointed commander-in-chief
of the insurgents. In February, 1823, Echavarri, the
commander of the imperialists, joined forces with Victoria
and Santa Anna.</p>

<p>Defection now became general among the officers of the
army; in consequence of which, Iturbide was obliged to
surrender his power. Hastily assembling at Mexico the
dispersed members of congress, on the 19th of March,
1823, he tendered them his abdication of the crown. Congress
allowed him a yearly pension of twenty-five thousand
dollars, on condition of his leaving the Mexican territory
for ever. On the 11th of May, he embarked for Leghorn.</p>

<p><i>Adoption of the Federal Constitution.</i>&mdash;A provisionary
government was immediately established, and a triplicate
executive appointed, consisting of Generals Victoria, Bravo,
and Negrete. Measures were at once adopted for the convocation
of a new congress, which, upon assembling, entered
on the arduous plan of framing a constitution of government.
This they did on the federative plan, and on the 2d of February,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_824" id="Page_824">[Pg 824]</a></span>
it was sworn to in the capital, amidst the rejoicings
and acclamations of the people. The government soon
went into operation, and Victoria was chosen president of
the republic, and Bravo vice-president.</p>

<p>Contrary to the decree of perpetual banishment against
him, Iturbide returned to Mexico in disguise; but, being
discovered, he was shot. This took place on the 10th of
July, 1824. Several disturbances had occurred, partly
on his account, during his absence; but the republic was
now relieved from one great source of disquietude.</p>

<p>The general provisions of the new constitution, as to the
distribution of the powers of government into their parts,
were the same as those of the constitution of the United
States; but they differed as to the right of trial by jury,
which was omitted, and the Roman Catholic religion was
alone to be tolerated in Mexico.</p>

<p><i>Prosperity of the years 1825 and 1826.</i>&mdash;The new government
was now acceptable to the Mexican people. The
administration of Victoria was popular, and measures were
maturing for cementing the union of states, and for consolidating
the public liberty. Much was done, also, to stimulate
the industry of the people. The prospect of public peace,
order, and liberty in Mexico, was such as to attract thousands
of emigrants from the United States and from Europe.
Wealth, and comfort, and honors, were held out as a reward
of virtue and enterprise. But the pleasant vision soon vanished,
and this ill-fated country was again the theatre of
turmoil and contention.</p>

<p><i>Election of a President in 1828.</i>&mdash;Victoria's term now
expiring, a new president was to be chosen; among the
prominent candidates for which office were General Guerréro,
and Gomez Pedraza, then secretary of war. The
canvass resulted in the choice of Pedraza; but the friends
of Guerréro soon set up a claim in his favor, alleging that,
in taking the votes, he was defeated solely by fraud.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_825" id="Page_825">[Pg 825]</a></span></p>

<p>At the session of the new congress in January, 1829, the
house of representatives proclaimed Vincent Guerréro to be
duly elected president, on the constitutional ground that he
had the majority of the <i>legal</i> votes. General Bustamente,
who had been supported by the partisans of Pedraza, was
declared to be duly elected vice-president; and in organizing
the new administration, Zavala, then governor of the
state of Mexico, was appointed secretary of state, and
General Santa Anna, secretary of war.</p>

<p><i>Usurpation of Bustamente.</i>&mdash;Soon after the declaration
of congress in favor of the election of Guerréro, that body
passed a resolution investing him with dictatorial powers,
in anticipation of an invasion by Spain, to recover possession
of Mexico. The Spanish army of four thousand five
hundred men, sent for that purpose, were defeated, and
compelled to retire. The continuance of his extraordinary
power was now no longer necessary; yet Guerréro continued
to exercise it, and in a manner and for purposes not
contemplated. This brought upon him the censure of Bustamente
and others, who saw in his measures a desire to
perpetuate his dictatorship. Yet, on the 11th of December,
Guerréro resigned his dictatorship into the hands of congress,
and retired to his estate. Bustamente immediately assumed
or usurped the presidency, pretending that he was actuated
solely by a desire to restore the constitution, which had
been violated in the elevation of Guerréro to the presidency.
The latter now fled to the mountains, but circumstances, in
the spring of 1830, seeming to favor an attempt to regain
his lost authority, he embarked in the enterprise, and the
whole country was again in arms. He was, however,
unsuccessful, and falling into the hands of his opponents, he
was condemned as a traitor, and executed in February, 1831.</p>

<p><i>Defence of the Federal Constitution.</i>&mdash;The measures of
Bustamente directly tended towards the establishment of a
strong central government, as those of Guerréro had been in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_826" id="Page_826">[Pg 826]</a></span>
favor of a perpetual dictatorship. On the ground of Bustamente's
procedure in his government, Santa Anna, in 1832,
placed himself at the head of the garrison of Vera Cruz, and,
as a pretext for revolt, demanded a rëorganization of the
ministry. His declarations were in favor of the constitution
and the laws, and consequently rallied the friends of
the federal system to his support. War soon began to
rage, and it was not until nearly a year, that an accommodation
was made, when it was agreed that Pedraza should
be restored to the government. He was accordingly
restored, and by means of his favorable notice of Santa
Anna, now his friend, but formerly his enemy, he exerted
such an influence, that the latter was elected his successor
in 1833. Gomez Farias was chosen vice-president. The
federal system was now apparently rëestablished under the
new administration.</p>

<p><i>Proceedings of Santa Anna&mdash;a Central Republic Established.</i>&mdash;From
the first moment of Santa Anna's accession
to the presidency, he was inflamed with a desire for dictatorial
power. He seized an opportunity to desert the
federal republican party, and joined the centralist faction.
By a military order, he dissolved the constitutional congress
in May, 1834, and in January, 1835, he assembled a revolutionary
and aristocratic congress, which deposed the vice-president
Farias, and elected General Barragan, a leading
centralist, in his place. About the same time, through the
influence of Santa Anna, the constitution of 1824 was abolished
by congress, as were also all the state constitutions
and state authorities, and a central republic was established
in its place. So violent a measure proved unacceptable to
several of the states. Zacatecas submitted, and declared for
centralism. "The torch of liberty was now extinguished
in the republic, and military despotism fully established."
No! it was not quite extinguished. One Mexican territory,
Texas, with her by fifty thousand bold inhabitants, chiefly
emigrants from the United States, was ready to resist the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_827" id="Page_827">[Pg 827]</a></span>
dictates of a usurper and a despot. Santa Anna felt at
once the importance of reducing Texas, and of defeating
the Americans or driving them from the country. He
made the attempt with an army of eight thousand men, but
when he supposed that his object had been attained, he was
suddenly attacked at San Jacinto, by General Houston, who
routed his troops, and took him prisoner. This occurred on
the 21st of April, 1836. After being a prisoner several
months, he was permitted to return to Mexico, where, in
the mean time, his authority as president had been superseded,
and where he passed several years in obscurity, on
his own hacienda (farm).</p>

   <p class="caption2">Texans Flying to Arms.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Attempts against the Central Government.</i>&mdash;Two successive
attempts were made against the central government
during the years 1837 and 1838, under Bustamente, who
had been chosen president after his return from France.
The first consisted of declarations in favor of federation,
and of Gomez Farias for the presidency; but the disturbance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_828" id="Page_828">[Pg 828]</a></span>
was easily quelled. The other attempt was made by
Mexia in 1838, who had once before raised the standard of
rebellion against the central government. He was opposed
by Santa Anna, who had issued from his retirement, and
who hoped, by rendering some service to the government,
to wipe off the disgrace which attached to his name. Mexia
was unfortunate, and, being taken prisoner, was almost
instantly shot. Santa Anna appeared again on the stage,
in resisting an attack from an invading French expedition
against the town of Vera Cruz.</p>

<p>An insurrection commenced with the federalist party, in
the month of July, 1840, headed by General Urrea and
Gomez Farias, and, for a time, the prospect was favorable
for another reform of the constitution.</p>

<p><i>Revolution of 1841.</i>&mdash;But revolutions were not at an end
in Mexico. An insurrection broke out in the month of
August, 1841, the result of which was, the bombardment
of the capital, the downfall of Bustamente, and the convention
of Tacubaya. Santa Anna took a part in this revolution
against the president, and being at the head of the army, he
selected the junta, which, according to the "plan of Tacubaya,"
was to choose the president of the republic. The
junta repaid the distinction conferred upon them by selecting
him for that high office. The congress, however, which
assembled in June, 1842, proving to be disagreeable to Santa
Anna, he dissolved it by an authoritative act, and, convening
an assembly of notables, they fixed on a new constitution.</p>

<p><i>A New Constitution.</i>&mdash;This was proclaimed on the 13th
of June, 1843, and conferred almost all the power on the
national executive. Santa Anna himself having been chosen
that executive, the new government was organized by the
assembling of congress in January, 1844. There was little
agreement between that body and the dictator, as he might
now be called, and hostility to his administration began to
be expressed throughout the country. Measures were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_829" id="Page_829">[Pg 829]</a></span>
accordingly taken for his overthrow, in which Paredes, who
had commenced the revolution of 1841, bore a conspicuous
part. At the head of a body of troops, he openly declared
against the dictator, and soon carried with him several of
the northern provinces.</p>

<p><i>Overthrow of Santa Anna's Government.</i>&mdash;The people
in the capital soon arose in arms; the military declared
against the dictator, and on the rëassembling of congress,
General Herrera, the leader of the constitutional party, was
appointed provisional president of the republic, and a new
ministry was formed. This was an occasion of unbounded
rejoicing throughout the country. Santa Anna, however,
with the troops still under his command, attempted to
rëgain his lost authority; but meeting with defeat and disappointment,
he endeavored to escape, having first proposed
to his opponents terms that were not accepted. This
occurred in January, 1845. He was taken prisoner, and
confined several months in the castle of Perote; after which,
congress passed against him a decree of perpetual banishment
from Mexico.</p>

<p>In the mean time, the province of Texas having maintained
its independence during nine years, and having been
acknowledged therein by the United States and several
European powers, was, upon its own application, received
into the confederacy of the former, and became a constituent
part of the great American Union. This annexation became
the occasion of the war between Mexico and the United
States, of which an account is given in the history of the
latter country.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Locality</span>&mdash;Extent&mdash;Physical Character&mdash;Discovery and Conquest&mdash;Independence
of the Country.</p></blockquote>

<p>Guatemala, or the "Republic of Central America," is the
most southern point or portion of the North American continent,
exclusive of the isthmus. It has an area of one
hundred and eighty-five thousand square miles. It is composed
of five states, which are sub-divided into districts,
and of the federal district, which contains the seat of
government.</p>

<p>The soil of the country is in general good, and exhibits
the same variety as in Mexico, with similar productions.
In portions of it, Guatemala is subject to tremendous convulsions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_831" id="Page_831">[Pg 831]</a></span>
of nature. This is the case mostly in the mountainous
regions, of which there is a lofty chain, traversing
the country, and presenting a series of twenty-one volcanic
summits in constant activity. Old Guatemala, the capital
of the state of Guatemala, has been several times destroyed
by earthquakes, as it lies between the volcanoes of Agua
and Fuego.</p>

<p><i>Discovery and Conquest.</i>&mdash;Guatemala, like the other
portions of the American continent in this quarter, was
discovered by the Spaniards. It appears never to have
formed a part of the empire of Mexico. At the arrival of
the Spaniards, it contained many distinct kingdoms or principalities.
The natives, called <i>Quiches</i>, lived in cities, and
some ruins of their works are yet visible. The subjugation
of Mexico by Cortez, struck terror into the inhabitants of
Guatemala, and some of the chiefs sent embassies to the
conqueror, offering to submit to him, and acknowledging
themselves vassals of the Spanish king. Cortez dispatched
Pedro de Alvarado, one of his officers who had been most
active in the conquest of Mexico, to take possession of
the country.</p>

<p>Alvarado marched from Mexico in November, 1523, with
three hundred Spaniards, and a large auxiliary force of
Mexicans. He met, however, with strenuous opposition in
his progress. The Indians were defeated in several engagements,
and the Spaniards remained masters of the provinces
in which these engagements took place. On entering
the kingdom of Quiche, they met with a more serious
resistance than they had received elsewhere. The invaders,
nevertheless, on the 14th of May, 1524, gained the victory
in a great battle. Alvarado continued his march to the
capital of the king of Kachiquel, who had sent his submission
to Cortez. This prince received the stranger with
courtesy, and on the 29th of July, 1524, they laid the
foundation of the ancient city of Guatemala. The conquest
of the remaining provinces followed soon after,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_832" id="Page_832">[Pg 832]</a></span>
although many savage wilds have remained to the present
day very little explored or known by the conquerors.</p>

   <p class="caption2">Alvarado marching on Guatemala.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Independence of the Country.</i>&mdash;The people of Guatemala
declared Guatemala independent on the 15th of September,
1821, and subsequently it was incorporated with Mexico;
but on the fall of Iturbide, it disconnected itself from Mexico,
and formed a separate independent republic on the 4th
of July, 1843, under the title of the "Federation of Central
America."</p>

<p>The constitution of the republic is modeled on that of
the United States. The president and vice-president are
elected for four years. The senate is composed of two
members from each of the states, and the house of representatives
consists of deputies (one deputy for thirty thousand
inhabitants) elected by the people. They have
abolished slavery in this country, as well as in Mexico. No
other religion than the Catholic is tolerated in Guatemala,
that being the established faith.</p>

of Quito&mdash;The Crisis of 1828&mdash;Separation of New
Grenada, Venezuela, and Equator&mdash;State of the Government since the
Separation.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Extent and Physical Features.</i>&mdash;New Grenada constitutes
the north-west portion of the South American continent,
commencing with the isthmus, and extending down on
the western coast nine hundred and eighty miles. It contains
an area of three hundred and eighty thousand square
miles. The country is traversed by several chains of the
Andes, the basis of which consists of elevated plains or table-lands,
which are many thousand feet above the level of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_834" id="Page_834">[Pg 834]</a></span>
sea. The soil is extremely fertile, and produces in great
richness and abundance the various fruits and vegetables
of the tropical regions. The climate is hot and unhealthy
in the low country on the coast, but on the table-lands is
found a perpetual spring.</p>

<p><i>Revolution of</i> 1811.&mdash;Soon after the invasion of Spain by
the French in 1808, a revolutionary spirit began to manifest
itself in the Spanish colonies of South America; and in the
course of a few years, all these colonies, one after another,
declared themselves independent, and formed republican
constitutions, most of which took that of the United States
as a model, in a great measure. But the people were ill-prepared
for free governments. Their character, education,
and habits were little in accordance with republicanism.</p>

<p>New Grenada declared itself an independent state in
1811, and after a long and severe struggle with the mother-country,
expelled the Spaniards from its territory. The
memorable victory of Carabobo, in 1821, completed the
overthrow of the Spanish authority. In this battle, an
army of six thousand royalists was nearly annihilated, only
four hundred men saving themselves by taking shelter in
Porto Cavello. The patriots were led on by Bolivar.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>
Previously to this period, viz: in 1819, a union was decreed
of New Grenada and Venezuela into one republic, under the
name of Columbia, the presidency of Quito having subsequently
succeeded to the confederacy.</p>

<p><i>Formation of a Constitution.</i>&mdash;On the 17th of July,
1821, a general congress met at <i>Rosario de Cucuta</i>, to form
a constitution, which was completed and adopted on the
30th of August. The legislative power was vested in a
senate of thirty-six members, and in a chamber of deputies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_835" id="Page_835">[Pg 835]</a></span>
of ninety-four members, and Simon Bolivar was elected
president, and Santander vice-president. Bolivar and Santander
were both rëelected for a second term, commencing
on the 1st of January, 1827.</p>

<p><i>Liberation of Quito.</i>&mdash;In respect to the liberation of
Quito, it appears that the destruction of the royal army,
on the plains of Carabobo, enabled Bolivar to direct his
whole attention to the expulsion of the Spaniards from the
southern provinces. The presidency of Quito, afterwards
formed into the republic of Equador, had, for many years,
been united with New Grenada. The army of the South,
under Sucre, was rëinforced by the troops which could be
spared from other situations, amounting to seven thousand
men, and the president placed himself at its head. Both
parties having at length concentrated their forces, the campaign
and the fate of Quito were decided at the battle
fought at Pinchincha, about the 1st of June, 1822. Bolivar's
usual success still attended him, and the arms of the
republic were again crowned with a most signal victory.</p>

<p><i>The Crisis of 1828.</i>&mdash;In 1828, the country was threatened
with anarchy, and Bolivar took a decisive step&mdash;and
daring as it was decisive&mdash;in dissolving the Columbian congress
on the 27th of August of that year, and assuming
absolute authority. To this movement he had been encouraged
by addresses from various municipal bodies, calling
upon him to put an end to the public disorders, by taking
upon himself that authority. He organized a new government
to suit his own views, and soon began to feel the
consequences of the bold measure he had adopted, in the
conspiracies that were formed against him. The month of
September did not pass without an attempt to assassinate
him. His aid-de-camp was killed, but Bolivar's life was
saved by the courage of his officers. Generals Padilla and
Santander were charged with this plot, and by a special
tribunal condemned to death. The former was executed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_836" id="Page_836">[Pg 836]</a></span>
but the punishment of Santander was commuted for banishment.
Several other individuals suffered death. The country
was more or less agitated by violent factions; many
military leaders aspired to the supreme command, and
Bolivar's efforts to prevent dissension incited insurrections.
Many denounced him as a usurper and tyrant. Venezuela
claimed her independence, and Bolivar, after endeavoring
in vain to unite them, and create a spirit of harmony under
his rule, resigned all his authority to the congress at Bogota,
in 1830. He retired to Carthagena in deep depression of
spirits, on account of the calamities of his country.</p>

<p><i>Separation of New Grenada, Venezuela, and Ecuador,
or Equator.</i>&mdash;On the 4th of May, 1830, Senor Joachim
Mosquera was elected president, and General Domingo
Caicedo, vice-president; but on the 4th of September, Mosquera
resigned, and Urdanata was appointed temporary
president until the arrival of Bolivar, whose return to power
was decreed by a meeting of soldiers and citizens; but
Bolivar died at Carthagena, December 17th, the same year.
Venezuela again joined Columbia for a short time; but in
November, 1831, a new separation took place, and since
that time the late republic of Columbia has been divided
into three republics, viz: New Grenada, Venezuela, and
Equator, whose constitutions are similar to that of Columbia.</p>

<p><i>State of the Government since the Separation.</i>&mdash;Since
this period, there seems to have been a regularity in the
appointment of the highest officers of the government. In
1832, General Santander was called to the presidency,
whose term of office expired in 1836. The next term of
four years was filled by José Ignacio de Marquez. Of late
years&mdash;that is, for two successive terms&mdash;General Herran
has been president of New Grenada. Don Thomas C.
Mosquera was elected president of the republic in 1848.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Name</span>, Physical Features, &amp;c.&mdash;Discovery&mdash;State of the Country under the
Spanish Dominion&mdash;Termination of the Spanish Dominion&mdash;Condition since.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Name, Physical Features, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;This republic formerly
known by the name of the Captain-generalship of Caraccas,
as has been seen, once formed a part of the republic
of Columbia. When it was first brought to the knowledge
of the Spaniards, they called the place where they landed
Venezuela, from the common propensity to find a resemblance
between the objects they saw in America, and those
that were familiar to them at home. An Indian village,
built upon piles, was the object which suggested the name.</p>

<p>Venezuela includes a portion of the great chain of the
Andes and a vast plain, which constitutes the greater part
of the surface. It is watered by the Orinoco, one of the
largest rivers of the world, which empties into the Atlantic
by about fifty mouths. The area of Venezuela measures
four hundred and fifty thousand square miles. In respect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_838" id="Page_838">[Pg 838]</a></span>
to its soil, it has all the richness of the equatorial regions
of the globe.</p>

<p><i>Discovery.</i>&mdash;The Spaniards, under Ojeda, first visited this
country, in 1499. They made some attempts to settle at
the Indian village before adverted to, which they observed
built upon piles, in order to raise the huts above the stagnant
waters around. But their labors were, for the most
part, abortive. The reduction of the country was brought
about by soldiers of fortune, abounding in Germany in the
sixteenth century, who, through an arrangement of the
Emperor Charles V., were introduced into these wilds.
These adventurers, neglecting the purpose for which they
were placed there, which was to cultivate and improve the
country, became impatient to amass riches, and wandered
from district to district in search of mines. In this pursuit,
they cruelly plundered the natives, and imposed on them
intolerable tasks. In a few years, the desolated province
hardly afforded them subsistence; and when they were
removed by their employers, the Spaniards again took possession
of the country, and soon renewed the horrors which
it had already experienced. In consequence of these, and
other ravages at a later period, the whole region lay waste
for a long season. When new settlements were at length
commenced, they advanced so slowly, that this part of the
Spanish possessions remained comparatively unproductive,
while the other American colonies were in a thriving state.</p>

<p><i>State of the Country under the Spanish Dominion.</i>&mdash;As
in the other provinces held by Spain on this continent, the
Spanish dominion continued in this until the early part of
the nineteenth century. Venezuela was, however, agitated
by the question of freedom and independence, perhaps,
earlier than was the fact elsewhere in Spanish America.
As early as in 1797, an attempt to raise the standard of
independence was made in Venezuela, so keenly did the
country feel the rapacity and oppression of the Spanish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_839" id="Page_839">[Pg 839]</a></span>
government. Two natives of Caraccas were leaders in
this revolt, which comprised a large number of people distinguished
for their talents, virtues, and wealth. The
insurrection, which had for its object the securing of the
heads of government, as hostages, till a treaty could be
made with the court of Spain for a redress of grievances
was fixed for the 14th of July, 1797; but was divulged by
one of the conspirators on the evening previous. The
consequence was, that most of the conspirators were
arrested, and eventually put to death, but the leaders
effected their escape.</p>

<p>The discontents of the people continued, and General
Miranda, in consequence of earnest entreaties expressed in
letters from Venezuela, to put himself at the head of an
expedition for revolutionizing the country, acceded to the
proposal. Proceeding to the United States, he collected
there a body of a few hundred adventurers. With this
force he sailed from New York in 1806; but after arriving
on the coast, he was repulsed by the Spanish gun-boats; and
it was only after recruiting his forces at Trinidad, and aided
under the convoy of a British sloop, that he again proceeded
to the place of destination. He, however, effected nothing,
as he found the people now luke-warm in the cause of revolt,
and abandoned the project, with the loss of numbers of his
men, who were taken and hanged.</p>

<p><i>Termination of the Spanish Dominion.</i>&mdash;The Spanish
authority, however, over the province, was drawing to an
end. The great revolution broke out in 1810. On the 19th
of April, the captain-general of Caraccas was deposed, and
delegates were chosen by the people to meet in a congress,
for the purpose of forming a government for Venezuela.
The congress published a declaration of independence on
the 5th of July, 1811, and this example was followed by the
other provinces, which were afterwards united, as has
already been mentioned, in the republic of Columbia.</p>

<p>In so succinct an account as the present, the details of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_840" id="Page_840">[Pg 840]</a></span>
the revolution cannot be given, nor would they be specially
interesting or useful, from their want of general and permanent
results. It needs only to be stated, that the patriots
were generally successful till 1812, when they experienced
the terrible calamity of the loss of their city, Caraccas, by
an earthquake; a circumstance which wrought upon the
superstitious fears of the populace against the cause, and
that Miranda, who had returned to this country, in despair
capitulated, was taken a prisoner, and finally sent to Spain,
where he died in a dungeon.</p>

<p>From this period, through a series of years, the contest
maintained a doubtful character; Bolivar defeating the
royalists in several battles, and they in their turn defeating
him. The struggle between the parties continued, until
after the junction of New Grenada and Venezuela, in 1819.
The battle of Carabobo in 1820, as already related in the
history of the former state, put the finishing stroke to the
war in Venezuela. By the end of the year, the Spaniards
were driven from every part of the two provinces, except
Puerto Cabello and Quito.</p>

<p><i>Condition since the Overthrow of the Spanish Power.</i>&mdash;The
promise of better times soon after the union of New
Grenada and Venezuela, was realized but in part. The
country continued disturbed for years. In the mean time,
the republic of Columbia was formed, but, as already shown,
it was not destined to continue: its remembrance, however,
will always be connected with the heroic efforts of Bolivar.</p>

<p>The government of the country was administered from
1831 to 1835, by General José Antonio Paez, the president,
and 1835 to 1839, by Dr. Vargas, also the president. Since
the last-named period, the government has been in the hands
again of General Paez. From recent accounts, however, it
would seem that the country is in a disturbed state, a war
being carried on between Paez and Monagas&mdash;Paez representing
the constitutional party. Very lately, the latter
obtained a decided victory over Monagas.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Name</span>, Extent, Physical Character&mdash;Classes of the Inhabitants&mdash;Subversion of
the Spanish Authority&mdash;Condition since the Spanish Rule.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Name, Extent, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;This country derives its name from
its situation, it being intersected towards the north by the
equator. It is one of the three republics before spoken of,
formed from the territory which, before 1831, constituted
the republic of Columbia, and it comprehends the ancient
kingdom or presidency of Quito, and formerly constituted
a part of the vice-royalty of New Grenada. It has an area
of three hundred and twenty-five thousand square miles, and
a population of six hundred and fifty thousand souls.</p>

<p>The western part of Ecuador is traversed from north to
south by a chain of the Andes, forming a double ridge of
colossal summits; the valley between which, constitutes a
table-land of about twenty-five miles in width, and from
nine thousand to nine thousand five hundred feet in height.
Throughout this elevated valley, a perpetual spring is
enjoyed; while on the summits of the mountains the snows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_842" id="Page_842">[Pg 842]</a></span>
of winter are always seen; and in the low country, along
the coast, the heat is excessive, and the climate is dangerous
to foreigners. The whole eastern portion of the state
is traversed by the great River Amazon, which forms a part
of the southern boundary of the republic.</p>

<p><i>Classes of the Inhabitants.</i>&mdash;A small proportion only of
the inhabitants are whites, the Indians and mixed breeds
composing the bulk of the population. The civilized part
of the population is confined to the central valley and the
western coast, the vast tracts of land to the east of the
mountains being occupied by independent and hostile
tribes of savages. The aborigines belonged to the Peruvian
family, and numerous remains of their architectural
industry and skill are still visible.</p>

<p><i>Subversion of the Spanish Authority.</i>&mdash;Dissatisfaction
with the authority of the central junta of Spain, and generally
the anxiety which was felt for the fate of the colonies,
in case the French should prevail in the peninsula, led to
the establishment of a junta in the province of Quito in
August, 1809, and the Marquis Selva Allegre was chosen
its president.</p>

<p>The viceroy of New Grenada, Don Amar, determined
to destroy the junta; "but, desirous of exhibiting an appearance
of acting in conformity to the will of the people, he
convened the principal inhabitants of Santa Fe de Bogota,
for the purpose of consulting them on the subject, believing
that they would not have independence sufficient to oppose
his will. In this, however, he was disappointed. The
assembly not only approved of the proceedings at Quito,
but declared that a similar body ought to be formed in
Santa Fe, for the security of the country, in case Spain
should finally be conquered by the French.</p>

<p>"The assembly, with the consent of the viceroy, was
adjourned to meet again on the 11th of September, 1809,
the first meeting being on the 7th. Still thinking to intimidate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_843" id="Page_843">[Pg 843]</a></span>
the members, the viceroy required that each one
should give his vote in writing. When the assembly again
met, they were surprised to see that the guards of the
palace were doubled, and that great military preparations
had been made, as if an enemy was approaching the city.
But even this seasonable display of military force did not
have the effect of overawing the assembly; its debates
were bold and spirited; and the voting by written ballots,
showing the opinions of the different members, tended to
strengthen their firmness and resolution, so that the friends
of the measure were rather increased than diminished.</p>

<p>"This occasion first brought into notice several individuals,
who afterwards became distinguished patriots; Camillo
de Torres, Gutierrez, Father Padilla, and Moreno, were
among the number. Being at length persuaded that he
could not have the appearance of acting in conformity to
public opinion, he took immediate steps to suppress the
popular junta at Quito by an armed force; and the viceroy
of Peru having dispatched troops for the same object,
the junta was obliged to yield to a power which it had
no means of resisting. And although an assurance was
given by the president of the <i>audiencia</i> of Quito, that
no one should any way suffer on account of what had
taken place; yet, in violation of this plighted faith, a large
number of those who had belonged to, or supported the
popular government, were arrested and imprisoned, and on
the 2d of August, the following year, they were all massacred
in prison, under pretence of revolt. The troops
stationed in the city, after massacring the prisoners,
were suffered to plunder the inhabitants; the scene of rapine
and carnage was shocking, and involved the property of
thousands, and the lives of more than three hundred persons,
murdered in cold blood."</p>

<p>From this period, a long struggle ensued&mdash;most of the
incidents are common with those which have been narrated.
The Spanish authority was not entirely overthrown, until
the splendid victory of Pinchincha, in 1822; soon after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_844" id="Page_844">[Pg 844]</a></span>
which, Quito was united with Columbia. This union was
dissolved in 1830, and Quito formed an independent state.</p>

<p><i>Condition since the Spanish Rule.</i>&mdash;One of the early
presidents of the republic was Vincente Rocafuerte; more
lately, the executive department has been filled by Juan
Joseph Flores; according to the latest advices from Ecuador,
there are symptoms of a revolution. Numerous
accusations against the president have been brought forward.
What events may grow out of it, time will decide.
The instability of political affairs in that quarter of the
world has long been remarked; nor perhaps will it soon
cease to be a feature of the governments of South America.</p>

<p><i>Locality, Extent, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;Peru lies south of Equator
along the western shore of the continent, nearly central
between the isthmus and the Straits of Magellan, having
an area of five hundred thousand square miles, and a population
of one million eight hundred thousand. The country
is traversed by several chains of the Andes, from north to
south, the principal chain lying nearly parallel to the coast.
There exists a great variety as to the surface, soil, and
climate of Peru, portions of the country being sterile, with
no rains, and only dews; and others very fertile, abounding
in impenetrable forests of gigantic trees, and producing the
rich fruits and vegetables of tropical regions. The traveler,
according to his elevation, meets here with eternal snows
or perpetual summer, or the most excessive and deadly heat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_846" id="Page_846">[Pg 846]</a></span>
The gold and silver wealth of Peru has a world-wide
celebrity. The silver mines of Potosi are perhaps the
richest known, unless the recent golden treasures of California
shall be found to exceed them. Like the latter, the
former were first made known by accident. An Indian, by
the name of Hualpa, one day following some wild animals
up the mountain, laid hold of a shrub or tree to aid his
ascent; which, giving way, revealed a mass of silver ore,
which lay so near the surface as to cling to the roots. For
some time Hualpa kept his discovery a secret, but his rapid
increase of wealth attracting the notice of a countryman,
he revealed it to him. The friends, however, soon quarreled;
upon which, the secret was divulged.</p>

<p><i>Condition at the time of its Invasion by the Spaniards.</i>&mdash;"Peru
was one of the two monarchies of America which,
at the invasion of the Spaniards, had attained to a degree
of refinement far above that savage state in which most of
the American Indians lived. It was also remarkable from
the contrast of the character of its civilization to that of
the Mexicans. Instead of the fierce and lofty spirit, the
bloody wars, the uncouth deities, and ferocious rites of the
latter, the Peruvians were united in tranquil subjection to a
mild superstition, which represented their Inca as the child<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_847" id="Page_847">[Pg 847]</a></span>
of the sun, to whom unreserved submission was due.
However fable may have been mixed with the truth in the
tale of Manco Capac and his wife Mama Ocollo&mdash;who,
according to the traditions of the country, founded the
empire, first appearing among the people about the year
1100, claiming to be children of the sun&mdash;the story of the
greatness of the Peruvian empire has nothing fabulous.
It comprehended not only the vast region now called
Peru, but the territory of Quito or Ecuador, which is
covered with the monuments of the Incas. Order was
established in this vast region; the land was carefully
cultivated; the rivers were carefully employed in irrigating
the soil; mountains were formed into terraces to
receive the canals constructed for this purpose, and walls
were built to prevent the water from escaping; so that
large tracts, which have now relapsed into deserts, were
rendered productive."</p>

<p><i>Conquest by Pizarro.</i>&mdash;Francisco Pizarro, an uneducated
Spaniard, is entitled to the renown, or the infamy, of bringing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_848" id="Page_848">[Pg 848]</a></span>
this rich country under the dominion of Spain, in the
former part of the sixteenth century. The details are too
numerous to be here given; but suffice it to say, that with
two associates and about two hundred soldiers, he overran
this splendid empire, and filled it with rapine and blood.
The gentle and unsuspicious character of the natives rendered
them an easy prey to the artifice, cupidity, and
cruelty of these Spanish cut-throats. Pizarro's associates
were Diego de Almagro, a soldier of fortune, and Fernando
de Luques, a mercenary priest.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="illus-851.jpg" id="illus-851.jpg"></a>
   <img src="images/illus-851.jpg" alt="Valverde addressing Atahualpa." title="Valverde addressing Atahualpa."/>
   <p class="caption2">Valverde addressing Atahualpa.</p>
</div>

<p>Atahualpa, the Peruvian emperor, treated the strangers
with great courtesy, and sent them several valuable presents&mdash;fruits,
corn, emeralds, and vases of gold and silver. The
sight of the gold and silver served to render the Spaniards
more fierce, and prepare them for the cruel butcheries that
followed. The following morning, Atahualpa, attended by
fifteen thousand men, met Pizarro at a place previously
appointed. He was borne on a throne of gold. As the
procession approached Pizarro, a Dominican friar, by the
name of Valverde, made a long address to the emperor, in
which he endeavored to expound the Christian religion;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_849" id="Page_849">[Pg 849]</a></span>
following which, he proposed to him a submission to the
king of Spain, on the ground that the pope had made a
present to him of Peru.</p>

<p>To this, Atahualpa replied, that he was willing to be the
friend of the king of Spain, but not his vassal. The pope
he considered a very extraordinary personage to make a
present of that which did not belong to him; and as to those
whom the friar denominated Christians&mdash;"If," said he, "they
worship a God who died upon a cross, I worship the <i>Sun</i>,
who never dies." After further efforts at persuasion,
Valverde became indignant, and called upon the Spaniards
to vindicate their holy religion, and to wreak their just
vengeance upon dogs who could thus trample upon the
gospel. Upon this, a signal was given, and the work of
butchery commenced in the emperor's own palace. Pizarro
himself advanced towards Atahualpa, and took him prisoner,
while all around the princes of the race of the Incas, the
flower of the nobility, and other great men of the court,
were indiscriminately put to the sword.</p>

<p>The cruelties that were inflicted, from this time forward,
upon this unoffending people, and the riches amassed by
these rapacious adventurers, so abhorred of God and men,
are scarcely capable of enumeration, were it the object of
this succinct account to speak of particulars. While their
prince, being a prisoner, was condemned on some frivolous
pretext, and strangled at the stake, they were made to expiate,
by their death, the crime of owning a rich and beautiful
country. Their great city of Cuzco was entered by Pizarro,
in 1534, and plundered of its immense wealth. Indeed, the
thirst of blood and plunder was every where exhibited in
the progress of the Spaniards through the country. Had
the latter shown any degree of moderation and humanity,
they would probably have made themselves masters of the
empire without further bloodshed than this commencement
of the fearful tragedy. A people, by constitution and
training so mild and submissive, would have yielded to the
yoke without much reluctance. But the infinite variety of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_850" id="Page_850">[Pg 850]</a></span>
their calamities stirred up the people to revenge, and they
found agents to give it, for a time, a degree of effect. But
the Spaniards persevered in their efforts to overthrow the
country; large numbers poured into it from abroad, and all
resistance finally ceased. Those of the natives who were
most attached to their liberty, to their government, and to
their religion, took refuge at a distance among inaccessible
mountains. The greater part of them, however, submitted
to their conquerors.</p>

   <p class="caption2">Pizarro in Cuzco.</p>
</div>

<p>The fate of these robbers was, at length, as deplorable as
that of the subjects of their rapacity and cruelty. By
various causes irritated and enraged against each other, the
leaders fought among themselves, and the most revolting
scenes of revenge and hatred were exhibited in the result.
The original leaders of the enterprise were soon no more,
and others followed in the same path of robbery, blood, and
mutual jealousy and contention. These civil wars continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_851" id="Page_851">[Pg 851]</a></span>
through a series of years. Fortunately for this part
of the new world, the most seditious of the conquerors, and
of those who followed in their steps, had perished in these
wars. With their departure was connected a degree of
tranquillity, and then only the Catholic kings might with
truth style themselves the sovereigns of the Spaniards settled
in Peru.</p>

<p><i>Condition of the Country after the Conquest.</i>&mdash;The
native Peruvians, after their subjugation, quietly submitted
to the Spanish yoke for more than two centuries. They
felt keenly, in many instances, the wrongs inflicted on
them, but they had no power of resistance against a disciplined
European force. They were loaded with insupportable
burdens, yet it was useless to complain. The exactions
of their conquerors were most unreasonable and cruel, and
they passed their days in sorrow, groaning under the
severest bondage. It would seem that all memory of their
ancient independence, and the glories of the empire of
Manco Capac, was lost from among them. Under their
oppressions, their spirit and resolution appeared wholly to
depart; but events proved that they were capable of being
aroused&mdash;if by nothing better, at least by despair.</p>

<p><i>Insurrection in the latter part of the Eighteenth Century.</i>&mdash;The
sufferings of the natives became so extreme,
that they wanted nothing but a leader to induce them to
rise upon their oppressors, and attempt the overthrow of
the Spanish power. Such a leader was found in Tupac
Amaru, a descendant, on the mother's side, from an Inca of
that name. He was well fitted, in many respects, to head
an insurrection, having a commanding figure and intrepidity
of spirit. He animated his countrymen to many heroic
deeds, and, in the course of the rebellion, several successful
battles were fought, and many Spaniards killed in the
encounters, and many massacred in the progress of the
Indian arms; but these were, on the whole, unsuccessful;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_852" id="Page_852">[Pg 852]</a></span>
their irregularities were, perhaps, more than retaliated by
the Spaniards. Amaru was captured in the course of the
war, and drawn into pieces by wild horses, as the punishment
of his attempt to free his countrymen from oppression.
Several other leaders were likewise taken, and shared the
same cruel fate.</p>

<p>The principal leaders of the insurrection being no more,
the great body of the Indian population quietly returned to
vassalage, and bowed again under the galling yoke. Such
was the issue of an attempt for freedom, which filled Peru
with bloodshed and misery for the space of two years, and
of a war, in which, it is asserted, one-third of the population
of Peru perished by the hand of violence. It produced
no permanent or important change in the condition of the
Indians. They were rigidly prohibited the use of arms.
The tribute pressed more heavily afterwards, and was
more strictly levied, and that unfortunate people were
treated more contemptuously, in revenge of their unsuccessful
rebellion.</p>

<p><i>Revolutionary Movements in the early part of the Present
Century.</i>&mdash;Previously to the French invasion of Spain, and
the confusion into which the mother-country was thrown
by that event, and the consequent facilities and inducements
which were furnished to the colonies in respect to their
independence, an attempt had been made in Peru, having
that object in view, as early as the year 1805. It was
undertaken by Ubalde, an eminent jurist of Cuzco; but it
proved to be a failure, and its author paid his life as the
forfeiture of his rashness.</p>

<p>In 1809, a popular movement took place, and provisional
juntas were established at Quito and La Paz. This revolutionary
design, however, was at once defeated by the
viceroys of Peru, Buenos Ayres, and New Grenada, whose
armies dissolved the juntas. After this second abortive
attempt, Peru remained tranquil for ten years, while the
neighboring provinces were engaged in the war of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_853" id="Page_853">[Pg 853]</a></span>
independence. At length, the people of Chili having
defeated the Spanish army in the decisive battle of Maypu,
in 1818, conceived the project of securing their independence
by expelling the Spaniards from Peru. A naval
armament and a land army both were fitted out for this
object; the one in 1819, and the other in 1820. The naval
force was commanded by Lord Cochrane, an English
adventurer, and the land force was commanded by General
San Martin.</p>

<p>Some obstacles were interposed to the immediate success
of the undertaking; partly from negotiation, and partly
from the insufficiency of the invading forces&mdash;the liberating
army of San Martin being only about five thousand strong,
and Cochrane being able only to blockade the Peruvian
ports. The city of Lima appeared to be too powerful for
an attack by the army of the general; but having, at length,
resolved on the enterprise of advancing upon this city, the
pusillanimity of the viceroy made way for a success which
force might not have achieved. The viceroy fled, to secure
his personal safety, while a deputation of citizens invited
San Martin to enter the city as a liberator.</p>

<p><i>Declaration of Independence.</i>&mdash;It was on the 12th of
July, 1821, that San Martin made his entry into Lima,
where he was received with acclamations, and, on the 28th,
the independence of Peru was formally declared. San
Martin took the title of Protector of Peru, with supreme
power, both civil and military. A provisional government
was organized, and measures were adopted to establish the
affairs of the country on a permanent basis. But the new
state of things was fluctuating. It was not until the 20th
of September, 1822, that the first Peruvian congress convened.
At this congress, an executive junta was appointed,
of three persons, to administer the government. San Martin
declined the office of commander-in-chief of the Peruvian
armies, and returned to Chili.</p>

<p>From this period, there was little promise of stability for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_854" id="Page_854">[Pg 854]</a></span>
the new republic. Discontent and dissensions followed
among the people, and every thing was thrown into confusion.
It was not until the great liberator, Bolivar, had
come among them, by invitation of a portion of the people,
and after three sanguinary battles had with the royalist
forces, that the Spanish power was prostrated in Peru. On
the 10th of December, 1824, the Peruvian congress was
again installed. Bolivar was then declared the political
and military head of the republic, as he had been once
before, and a gift of a million of dollars was tendered him
for his services, which he saw fit to refuse. Lower Peru
was thus liberated, and, as early as January, 1826, Upper
Peru experienced the same deliverance, through the arms
of the patriot General Sucre.</p>

<p><i>Condition of the Country after the Expulsion of the
Spaniards.</i>&mdash;Bolivar's influence was great, and a constitution
of government was adopted, which harmonized with
his views; but the people were still dissatisfied, and they
seized an occasion, when Bolivar was absent in Columbia,
of rising in insurrection, and effected a complete revolution
in the beginning of the year 1827. A new form of government
was adopted, combining the properties of a federal
and a central system, with a president, chosen for four
years, a national congress, and a separate provisional
government.</p>

<p>The republic, however, did not become settled by this
latter change; for the constitution of 1827, like that which
preceded it, has proved to be too little congenial to the taste
and capacities of the people. As late as 1835, four chiefs,
in arms, were striving for the supremacy; and one year
later, a spurious president, General Salaverry, having been
defeated in battle, was condemned to death by a court martial,
and shot, with his adherents, in the month of February,
1836. In 1837, Peru was placed under the protection of
Santa Cruz, president of Bolivia. Both Chili and Buenos
Ayres were at war with Peru, a few years since.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Name</span>, Extent, and Physical Character&mdash;Overthrow of the Spanish Power&mdash;Proclamation
of Independence&mdash;Choice of Rulers under the New Constitution&mdash;Present
Condition.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Name, Extent, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;This country, originally called
Upper Peru, and once forming a portion of the vice-royalty
of Buenos Ayres, or La Plata, dates from the battle of
Ayacucho, December 9th, 1828, in which the republicans,
under Sucre, completely defeated the royalists. The name,
Bolivia, given to it, was in compliment to Bolivar.</p>

<p>The republic has a length of one thousand one hundred
and forty-two miles, and an area of four hundred and ten
thousand square miles. In its physical features, it is marked
by several lofty peaks of the Andes. Some of them exceed
twenty thousand feet in height. The inequality of the surface
gives it a great variety as to temperature and climate.
In the central portion of it, the soil has great agricultural
capabilities. The mineral wealth of the country is very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_856" id="Page_856">[Pg 856]</a></span>
considerable&mdash;the famous mine of Potosi, which has heretofore
been particularly noticed, now belongs to Bolivia.</p>

<p><i>Overthrow of the Spanish Power.</i>&mdash;The provinces of
Upper Peru having been wrested from the Spaniards, as
above stated, General Sucre soon cleared the country of
the royalist forces. As he advanced into the territory, not
only was he received with universal joy by the inhabitants,
but the royal corps, in various places, spontaneously declared
for the independence of the country. Sucre reached Potosi
in April, 1825, where Olaneta, the Spanish general, made
what resistance he was able, but was himself slain, and the
royal troops in Upper Peru surrendered to the conquerors.</p>

<p><i>Proclamation of Independence.</i>&mdash;The upper territories
being thus emancipated, a general congress of delegates
was convened to decide on the political destiny of the
intendencies; whether they would unite with Lower Peru,
or the United Provinces, or form a separate and independent
nation. The latter was chosen; and, on the 6th of
August, 1825, a solemn declaration of the independence of
Upper Peru was published. The congress, which assembled
at Chiquisaca, gave the new republic its name, and
determined to call the capital <i>Sucre</i>, the name of the general
whose exploits have so often been spoken of. Having
solicited Bolivar to prepare a constitution, the congress dissolved
itself on the 6th of October. The constitution
which was proposed by Bolivar, and adopted by the congress
in 1826, vested the executive power in a president
chosen for life, with the privilege of naming his successor,
and the legislative power in three bodies: a senate, tribune,
and censors. But this constitution was soon abolished.</p>

<p><i>Choice of Rulers under the New Constitution.</i>&mdash;Sucre, at
the time of the adoption of the Bolivarian constitution,
resigned his discretionary power, and was elected president;
but he sent in his resignation to the congress which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_857" id="Page_857">[Pg 857]</a></span>
assembled on the 3d of August, 1828, and returned to
Columbia, and, in June, 1830, he was assassinated near
Pasto. On the retirement of Sucre, General Velasco filled
the office of president, till the meeting of the convention,
on the 16th of December. This body displaced Velasco,
and elected General Blanco president. A revolution soon
followed, which resulted in the deposition and death of
Blanco, January 1st, 1829. A temporary government was
established, with Velasco at the head, till a new president
could be elected, and Santa Cruz was chosen. Generals
Velasco and Ballivian have since been elected presidents
of the republic; the latter is still in office.</p>

<p><i>Present Condition.</i>&mdash;The most recent accounts represent
Bolivia as being in a state of civil war. The antagonists
of President Ballivian have proclaimed the constitution of
1839, and constituted a provisional government, backed by
a powerful military organization. The revolution is headed
by General Belza, minister of war, who has violated his
oath of office, disgraced his country, and outraged constitution
and laws, for the purpose of gaining the presidency.</p>

Condition.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Extent, Physical Features, Climate, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;Chili, lying on
the shore of the Pacific, from the twenty-fourth to the forty-fifth
degrees of south latitude, its length being one thousand
two hundred and sixty miles, and its breadth three hundred
miles, possesses many natural advantages and attractions.
The immense chain of the Andes traverses the country
from north to south. In the vicinity of these mountains,
earthquakes are common, and these seem to be the only
drawbacks to the paradise which nature has formed in this
part of the South American continent. Chili, it is believed,
is blessed with the most salubrious and delightful climate
on the globe.</p>

<p>Though there are some sterile tracts, the soil, in general,
is remarkably fertile, and the products are rich and varied.
Medicinal, dyeing, and aromatic plants abound, and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_859" id="Page_859">[Pg 859]</a></span>
are several plants peculiar to the country. All kinds of
metal abound in Chili. Gold, however, is the most copious,
and in some districts there is scarcely a hill which does not
contain it. Chili is supposed to be the only American state,
formerly subject to Spain, whose commerce has been
increased since the separation from the mother-country.</p>

   <p class="caption2">Almagro marching against Chili.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Conquest by Almagro.</i>&mdash;After the principal provinces of
Peru were brought into subjection, the Spanish conquerors
turned their attention to the conquest of Chili. In the early
part of 1535, Almagro set out for Cuzco, in the prosecution
of this enterprise, with a considerable force. From the
nature of the route, he met with great difficulties, and lost
many of his men; but he at length accomplished his design,
and was received with tokens of submission on the part of
the inhabitants. The natives, however, at length, recovering
from their astonishment at the sight of so superior a race of
men as the Spaniards, began to think of regaining their liberty.
Hence, a war arose, which lasted ten years, in which,
though the natives were sometimes successful, they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_860" id="Page_860">[Pg 860]</a></span>
generally and in the end defeated. For a long course of
years, the possession of the country by the Spaniards continued
to be disputed, and fatal hostilities occurred from
time to time, as they attempted to extend their empire in
Chili. Their object, however, was effected by degrees, as
in all the other American colonies.</p>

<p><i>Revolution in the beginning of the Present Century.</i>&mdash;The
occasion of the revolution in Chili, and its subsequent
independence, was the same as in the other Spanish states
in America, viz: the disturbances in Spain in consequence
of the French invasion in 1809. The captain-general of the
province was compelled to resign, and by the popular voice
the Count de la Conquista was elevated to his place. The
count immediately took measures for instituting a new government.
A general congress was determined on, and at
length chosen, after some attempts made by the royalists at
a counter-revolution. The congress, upon their organization,
passed a decree, permitting all persons who were dissatisfied
with the changes in the government, to leave the country
with their effects, within six months. The children of slaves,
born in future, were declared free, and many other acts
were passed, with a view to reform the abuses of the ancient
government.</p>

<p>Discontent, however, with the new order of things, soon
arose, and there was the usual amount of plots and counter-plots,
menace and fighting, between the friends and the
enemies of the changes in the government, which has constituted
a principal feature of Spanish American history in
modern times. After various military movements and internal
struggles, the revolutionary power was overthrown, and,
in 1814, the Spanish authority was completely rëestablished
in Chili.</p>

<p><i>Final Establishment of Independence.</i>&mdash;This state of
things continued for more than two years. But it was
destined to pass away, after some severe fighting. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_861" id="Page_861">[Pg 861]</a></span>
government of Buenos Ayres dispatched an army, under
San Martin, for the purpose of liberating Chili. After
incredible exertions and fatigue, he crossed the lofty chain
of the Andes, and arrived in Chili with very little loss. At
Chacabuco, the royal troops were defeated, and put to the
rout, on the 12th of February, 1817. At Santiago, the
liberator was received with acclamations by the inhabitants,
and made supreme director. He, however, declined the
office, and bestowed it upon O'Higgins, who had commanded
a division of his army. Chili was delivered by means of
San Martin's successes, ending in the great victory of
Maypu, April 5th, 1818, in which the whole Spanish army
was destroyed, with the exception of their commander,
Osorio, and a few horsemen. This victory set the seal on
the independence of Chili, and the patriots were soon
enabled to carry the war into the enemy's country by the
invasion of Peru, as narrated in the history of the latter.</p>

<p><i>Condition subsequently to the Establishment of Independence.</i>&mdash;The
fact of securing her independence has given
little repose to Chili. The outward forms of a republic
have been preserved in her government, while parties have
struggled for the ascendancy, and filled the country with
turbulence. For several years, the southern frontiers were
disturbed by the depredations of an outlaw, named Benavides,
a Spaniard, who put himself at the head of the Araucanian
Indians, and desolated the country with fire and
sword, and the commission of bloody atrocities unsurpassed
in the history of savage warfare. His success, and the
authority he had acquired over the Indians, induced him to
think himself a powerful monarch, and he attempted to
establish a navy. He captured several American and
English vessels, which touched on the coasts of Chili for
refreshments, and made himself master of a large amount
of property, arms, and military stores. The Spaniards
encouraged him in his piracies and murders, and furnished
him with troops and artillery. But his bloody career was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_862" id="Page_862">[Pg 862]</a></span>
cut short by the Chilians, who dispatched an expedition
against him in October, 1821. Arauco, his capital, was
taken, his forces defeated, and Benavides compelled to flee.
He was taken prisoner in February, 1822, tried and executed.</p>

<p>In January, 1823, O'Higgins was compelled to resign,
and was succeeded by Ramon Freire, as supreme director.
In July, 1826, Freire resigned his office, and Admiral Manuel
Blanco was appointed in his place; but before the
expiration of two months, he retired from office. In 1827,
the form of the government was changed; but the public
tranquillity has not been secured by the change. Of the
two vice-presidents, who were chosen from 1827 to 1831,
one was expelled and the other assassinated. Chili, for
many years, has been agitated by the dissensions of two
parties; the one desiring to establish a central government,
and the other, a government like that of the United States.</p>

<p>Chili, in connection with Buenos Ayres, within a few
years, has been at war both with Peru and Bolivia.
According to the latest accounts, some difficulty now exists
between this country and Buenos Ayres; the hope is
expressed that it may not issue in war. The too great
readiness of the infant republics of South America to
engage in contentions with one another, and to indulge in
internal feuds, must be acknowledged to be a bad omen in
respect to their preparation for the blessings of liberty and
independence.</p>

Insurrection against the Government of Spain&mdash;Progress and Changes
of the New Government&mdash;Present Condition of the Government.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Name, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;This country received its name, at first,
from the name of its great river La Plata. The river
was so denominated from the fact that, among the spoils of
a few Indians, inhumanly put to death, some ornaments of
gold and silver had been found. In 1778, it was erected
into a Spanish vice-royalty by the name of the vice-royalty
of Rio de la Plata. On its declaration of independence, in
1816, it assumed the name of the United Provinces of La
Plata, and, in 1826, that of the Argentine Republic; and it
has, also, long been known by the name of Buenos Ayres,
from the name of its chief city.</p>

<p><i>Inhabitants, or Classes of People.</i>&mdash;These are the same
as are found in Chili, viz: European Spaniards, Creoles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_864" id="Page_864">[Pg 864]</a></span>
Negroes, Indians, and the mixed races. The Chiquintos are
a numerous and civilized nation of independent Indians.
There are also many other tribes. There is a striking
sameness in the character of all the South American states.
Among the Creoles, the strictest equality obtains. No
white would do service for any one of his own nation.
Education, perhaps, in all the classes, is rather neglected.</p>

<p><i>Discovery and Settlement.</i>&mdash;Sebastian Cabot, in the early
part of the sixteenth century, sailed up the river, to which
he gave the name of La Plata. In attempting to build a
fortress in the country, or otherwise to commence a settlement,
he met with so much opposition from the inhabitants,
that, in 1530, he returned to Spain, in order to obtain
recruits. The few men whom he left in the colony, were
either massacred, or abandoned the country. Some more
considerable forces, led by Mendoza, came and settled on
the river in 1535, and laid the foundation of Buenos Ayres.
Their condition, however, was precarious, whether there, or
wherever else they located themselves in the country. They
were in danger of being cut off, either by famine or Indian
hostilities. Buenos Ayres was at length abandoned, and
settlements made farther up the river. To propitiate the
natives, they finally resorted to the policy of marrying
their women. From a union of this kind, sprung the race
of Mestizoes, which, in the course of time, became so
common in South America. Buenos Ayres was rebuilt in
1580, and from that time some of the petty nations in that
vicinity submitted to the Spanish yoke. A degree of civilization
and order was effected among this savage people,
by the Jesuits, through a long course of years.</p>

<p><i>First Insurrection against the Government of Spain.</i>&mdash;The
desire of throwing off the government of the mother-country
was manifested at an early period among the
inhabitants of the city of Buenos Ayres. The development
of this feeling was somewhat earlier there, than in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_865" id="Page_865">[Pg 865]</a></span>
other parts of Spanish America. It owed its origin to the
war which existed between Spain and Great Britain, in
1806. As the consequence of this war, the province of
La Plata was neglected, and thus presented a strong temptation
for invasion on the part of the British. That which
might have been attempted at some subsequent period by
public authority, was commenced by private aggressions, or
certainly without orders from the government. A fleet
and army, under Commodore Topham and General Beresford,
after effecting the conquest of the Cape of Good
Hope, proceeded to Buenos Ayres, on the 8th of June, 1806,
and, after a slight resistance, took possession of the place
on the 28th of June. The Spaniards, however, under
Liniers, a French officer, collecting a large force in the
country, rëtook it within sixteen days, with a good deal of
loss to the British. The latter having received rëinforcements,
made two several attempts to recover possession of
the city, but failed in both.</p>

<p>In the embarrassments occasioned by Napoleon's invasion
of Spain, parties sprang up in Buenos Ayres, some supporting
Liniers, who had been appointed viceroy of the province,
and others the Spanish authority. The latter appeared, for
a time, to be the prevailing power; but the ebulition of
royalty which had proclaimed Ferdinand, was of short
duration. The Spanish Americans began to feel that they
had power in their hands, as was manifested in their
defeat of the British. Their discontents increased at the
tyranny exercised over them. Commotion followed commotion,
till in May, 1810, the viceroy, Cisneros, finding his
embarrassments and perplexities greatly increased by the
disasters of the Spaniards at home, was compelled to
announce his inability to manage the government. By the
request of the municipality of the city, he called a congress,
which established a provisional junta for the government of
the country. The 25th of May, the date of this government,
has ever since been observed as the anniversary of
independence in Buenos Ayres.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_866" id="Page_866">[Pg 866]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Progress and Changes of the New Government.</i>&mdash;On the
part of Spain, attempts were made to recover her lost
power, and the difficulties and dissensions, so universally
experienced by the American colonies on such occasions,
were felt in a considerable degree in Buenos Ayres. In
1811, a congress assembled in the city of Buenos Ayres,
and placed the executive power in the hands of a triumvirate.
In 1812, Posadas was appointed supreme director of
the republic, with a council of seven. In 1816, a congress
assembled at Tucuman, declared the countries on the La
Plata independent, and named Pueyredon director; having
transferred its sessions to Buenos Ayres, it assumed the
title of the United Provinces of South America.</p>

<p>In 1819, a congress assembled at Buenos Ayres, formed
a constitution, modeled on that of the United States, and
Rondeau was elected supreme director, and Rivadavia was
placed at the head of foreign affairs. For some time, the
principal functions of the government were discharged by
a constituent congress, the executive power being intrusted
to the provincial government of Buenos Ayres.</p>

<p>In February, 1826, Rivadavia was elected president.
The republic became involved in war with Brazil, on
account of Banda Oriental, which was first added to Brazil,
and afterwards declared (August, 1828) independent. Rivadavia
having resigned, the congress was dissolved, each of
the provinces became again independent, and Dorego was
chosen governor of the province of Buenos Ayres. General
Lavalle, at the head of the Unitarios, caused Dorego
to be shot, and himself to be proclaimed president, December
1st, 1828. A bloody civil war ensued, and in August,
1829, Lavalle was compelled to resign, and his successor
was General Juan Jose Viamont, who was succeeded,
December 8th, 1829, by General Juan Manuel de Rosas,
who was declared dictator August 9th, 1830; but before
the end of the year, General Queroga made himself dictator
or governor. In 1835, De Rosas was made governor
of Buenos Ayres for five years; and, in addition to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_867" id="Page_867">[Pg 867]</a></span>
other duties, he was charged with the foreign relations of
the Argentine Republic.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>As early as the year 1822, the independence of the
United Provinces of La Plata was acknowledged by the
congress of the United States, and a treaty of commerce
was concluded with Great Britain in 1825. Domestic
troubles, however, were again renewed, the union of the
provinces was dissolved, and separate governments were
established. But the difficulties did not soon come to a
close, as two fiercely-contending parties, of opposite views
respecting the forms of government, created no small
amount of turbulence and misrule.</p>

<p>On December 29th, 1839, a battle was fought at Cagancha,
between General Echagne, governor of the Buenos
Ayrean province of Entre Rios, and General Fructuoso
Rivera, president of the Oriental Republic of Uruguay.
The former had an army of five thousand men, and was
defeated with a loss stated at eight hundred killed, and a
considerable number of prisoners, together with the loss of
their baggage and horses. The loss of General Rivera, in
killed and wounded, was stated at about two hundred.</p>

<p><i>Present Condition of the Government.</i>&mdash;The government
of this country, for many years past, has been in the hands
of Don Juan M. de Rosas. According to the latest
advices, Rosas is in trouble with the new British minister,
Mr. Southern. It is stated that the former refused to
receive Mr. Southern, unless he was authorized to treat
with Rosas on the basis laid down by Mr. Hood, the first
special minister that was sent out by England. Mr.
Southern refuses to submit to that condition, and thus the
affair remains at present.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Locality</span>, Extent, &amp;c.&mdash;Name and History&mdash;The Constitution.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Locality, Extent, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;This country lies north of the
Rio de la Plata, east of the river Uruguay, and south of
Brazil. It has an area of eighty thousand miles. Monte
Video is the capital of the republic, and is a town of some
importance. Uruguay comprises nine departments.</p>

<p><i>Name and History.</i>&mdash;This country constituted a part of
the vice-royalty, afterwards the republic of La Plata, and
was known by the name of Banda Oriental (Eastern Frontier,
from its geographical position). After the declaration
of the independence of the United Provinces, it became the
subject of an obstinate war between the new republic and
the empire of Brazil.</p>

<p>Elio, who was appointed by the regency of Spain captain-general
of the province of Rio de la Plata, in that
capacity, also, governed the province of Monte Video, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_869" id="Page_869">[Pg 869]</a></span>
the Banda Oriental. He was now the most dangerous and
powerful enemy with which the government of Buenos
Ayres were at war. That government having received an
ally, by the desertion of Artigas, a captain in the royal service,
employed him, in conjunction with General Rondeau,
in an expedition against Banda Oriental. In May, 1811,
they obtained a signal victory at Las Piedras over the royalists,
and laid siege to Monte Video. In this extremity,
Elio, finding himself unable to hold out long without assistance,
applied to the Portuguese of Brazil, who sent him an
army of four thousand men, and a subsidy of moneys.
Before any important operations could be engaged in, however,
a treaty was concluded between Monte Video and
Buenos Ayres, in November, 1811, by virtue of which the
siege of Monte Video was to be raised, and the Portuguese
forces were to return home. In pursuance of the treaty,
the siege was raised, but the Portuguese proved faithless,
and began to ravage the territory of La Plata.</p>

<p>Danger now encompassed the Buenos Ayreans, not only
from the Portuguese, but from the royalists of Peru. They,
however, induced the latter to withdraw their troops, and
the royalists they defeated in battle; but nothing could
restore quiet to the country, and hostilities were again commenced
with Monte Video. The war was carried on with
various success, and what, with this calamity and rival factions
which infested the city, little tranquillity was enjoyed,
till articles of agreement between the Brazilians and Buenos
Ayreans were signed at Rio Janeiro, August 27, 1828.
Then was effected the independence of the country, which
took the title of the Republic of Monte Video, so named
from its capital, but it has since assumed the title of the
Oriental Republic of Uruguay.</p>

<p>A constitution was adopted in 1830, according to which
the legislative power is vested in two bodies; a senate of
nine members, and a house of representatives of twenty-nine
members, and the code Napoleon was established as
the law of the country.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Situation</span>, Extent, &amp;c.&mdash;Discovery and Settlement&mdash;Policy of the Portuguese
Government&mdash;Removal of the Portuguese Court to Brazil&mdash;Constitution
and Government.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Situation, Extent, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;Brazil is an extensive country,
occupying the eastern and central portion of South America,
from four degrees north to thirty-three degrees south,
and from thirty-five degrees to seventy-three degrees west
longitude. It has an area of three millions square miles.</p>

<p>This region is traversed by several distinct chains of
mountains, chiefly in the eastern and northern provinces,
but they do not any of them reach to any great elevation.
"The mighty Orellana," or the Amazon, gives a character to
the country, as it is the largest river in the world, both in
regard to the length of its course and its volume of water;
draining an area of more than two millions of square miles,
and furnishing the country with the amplest means of intercommunication.
The greater part of Brazil is constituted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_871" id="Page_871">[Pg 871]</a></span>
of an immense immeasurable plain, through which flow
innumerable streams, on which stand boundless and impenetrable
forests, and the whole of which swarms "with
animal life in all its forms; ferocious beasts of prey, huge
serpents, alligators, troops of monkeys, flocks of gaudily-colored
and loquacious birds, and clouds of insects, are yet
undisturbed by the arts of man."</p>

<p>A great variety exists as to the climate. Intense heat
prevails under the equator, but rendered supportable by
the excessive humidity of the atmosphere and the copious
dews. Mild and temperate, with occasionally cold weather,
is experienced in the southern portions.</p>

<p>The soil is very fertile in a large portion of the country,
and produces an immense variety of rich and valuable
plants and vegetables, many of them being peculiar to this
region. The forests are admirable for their beauty and
grandeur; the growth of trees being gigantic, and the
number of ornamental ones surpassing calculation. An
important article of export, are several kinds of what is
called <i>Brazil-wood</i>, not to speak of timber for ship-building,
mahogany, and an infinity of dyeing woods.</p>

<p>The golds and diamonds of Brazil are far-famed; the
quantity of gold annually obtained being estimated at five
millions of dollars. Brazil has more foreign commerce
than any other country in America, except the United
States. Its principal ports are Rio Janeiro, Bahia or St.
Salvador, Pernambuco, Para, San Luis de Maranham, and
San Pedro.</p>

<p><i>Discovery and Settlement.</i>&mdash;The discovery of Brazil, by
the Portuguese, was a matter of accident. It occurred in
the year 1500, as Pedro Alvarez Cabral was sailing from
Lisbon with a fleet for the East Indies. Standing out a
great distance to the west, in order to avoid the calms on
the coast of Africa, he saw land, on the 24th of April, in
latitude seventeen south, and on the 3d of May landed at a
harbor which was named Porto Seguro. The country was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_872" id="Page_872">[Pg 872]</a></span>
named Brazil, eventually, from the circumstance that the
forests abounded with trees producing a beautiful dye-wood
of a fiery red, to which the Portuguese gave the name of
<i>brazil</i>, from <i>braza</i>, a live coal. Cabral having taken possession
of the country in the name of his sovereign, the
king of Portugal, dispatched a vessel to Lisbon, to announce
his important discovery, while he himself proceeded on his
voyage to India.</p>

<p>The king, gratified with the foregoing announcement, immediately
fitted out an expedition, under Amerigo Vespucci,
consisting of three ships, which sailed in 1501. Vespucci
explored the country as far south as the fifty-second degree
of latitude, but formed no settlement. After a voyage of
sixteen months, he returned to Lisbon. Two years after,
1503, he made a second voyage, in which he had the misfortune
to lose all his fleet, with the exception of his own
ship. During this visit, he established a settlement on the
coast, and carried home a cargo of brazil-wood, the value
of which was so great, as to induce many adventurers to
embark for that country. These volunteer colonists, composed
of various grades and conditions in the social scale,
but all imbued with the spirit of enterprise, formed a settlement
at St. Salvador.</p>

<p>The settlement which had been made on the coast in
1503, under Vespucci, received but little attention, until
certain French adventurers, about half a century afterwards,
attempted to settle a colony at Rio Janeiro. A
Portuguese force finally expelled the French from their
position, after a struggle of two years, in 1567&mdash;the French
having continued in different parts of the country, from
1558 till that time. Owing to various circumstances, the
Portuguese court, from making this region a place of exile
and confinement for convicts and the unhappy victims of
the Inquisition, was led to regard it, at length, as a place of
some importance. The sugar-cane began to be cultivated,
and the new luxury of sugar was sought with avidity. In
connection with this, a governor was sent out to manage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_873" id="Page_873">[Pg 873]</a></span>
the affairs of the settlers, and he built a city at St. Salvador,
which became the centre of the colony. The Jesuits,
however, were the most efficient class in building up the
colony, and conciliating the affections of the natives.</p>

<p>As misfortunes, during the latter part of the sixteenth
century, befel the Portuguese in Europe, advantage was
taken of their weakness, and their Brazilian possessions
were invaded and taken by the Dutch. But they were not
suffered to hold their conquest without molestation. In
1626, St. Salvador was rëtaken by the Portuguese; the
Dutch, however, retained their power for a number of
years in the country, and added to their conquests, till they
were expelled, in 1654, by a superior Portuguese force sent
against them. In 1661, the sole possession of Brazil was
secured to Portugal by treaty, in consideration of the sum
of one million seven hundred thousand dollars, which that
crown engaged to pay to the United Colonies.</p>

<p><i>Policy of the Portuguese Government in the latter part
of the Eighteenth Century.</i>&mdash;The measures adopted by the
government in respect to Brazil, were narrow and illiberal.
Their effect was to discourage industry, and to fetter commerce.
On the latter, restrictions and monopolies were
imposed. The search for gold and diamonds engrossed the
attention of the government. Foreigners could either gain
no admission into the country, or were jealously watched.
Trade was carried on only at the fortified posts. This disastrous
state of things continued till the beginning of the
present century, when an event took place which changed
the whole aspect of affairs in this country.</p>

<p><i>Removal of the Portuguese Court to Brazil.</i>&mdash;The event
above referred to, was the removal of the court in the
mother-country to this, its American colony. The design
of effecting such a change was entertained many years
before it took place; as early as 1761, the measure had
been determined on, and preparations were made; but it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_874" id="Page_874">[Pg 874]</a></span>
was not until 1808, that the project was put into execution.
The occasion was the declaration of war by Buonaparte
against Portugal. The regent (who, after the death of his
mother, in 1816, became king of Portugal, by the title of
John VI.), with the royal family, left Europe for Brazil,
where they arrived January 22d, 1808. This event resulted
in great advantage to the Brazilians. Soon, the old exclusive
system of trade was abolished, and all the ports of the
country were opened to the commerce of the world; the
free exercise of industry was permitted to all classes of
people; and the press, which for three centuries had been
prohibited, was immediately established.</p>

<p>After the fall of Napoleon, John raised Brazil to the rank
of a kingdom, in 1815, thenceforth to be called the kingdom
of Brazil, which, with the European territories, should constitute
the United Kingdoms of Portugal, Algarves, and
Brazil. In 1821, John returned to Portugal, leaving his
son, Pedro, in Brazil, as prince-regent. On the 12th of
October, 1822, Brazil was declared independent, as there
had been, for some time, a manifest and growing desire, on
the part of the people, for this change. At the same time,
the Prince Pedro was crowned emperor of Brazil. On the
death of John VI., in 1826, Pedro declared his daughter
Maria Queen of Portugal; and, on the 6th of April, 1831,
he abdicated the throne of Brazil in favor of his son, Pedro
II., born October 2d, 1825, and who is now emperor.</p>

<p><i>Constitution of Government.</i>&mdash;According to the constitution,
which was formed in 1823, and adopted in 1824,
Brazil is a hereditary monarchy, with a legislative assembly,
consisting of two houses; a senate, appointed by the emperor,
and a house of representatives, elected by the people.
The Catholic faith is the religion of the state, but all other
Christians are tolerated, though not allowed to build
churches, or perform divine service in public.</p>

on the east, and the Argentine Republic on the west. It
has an area of ninety thousand square miles. Its divisions
consist of eight departments.</p>

<p>This country is considered the fairest portion of what
was once the United Provinces. Its climate is mild and
balmy; the surface is not mountainous, neither is it a dead
level; it is well supplied with a great variety of streams
of pure water; its soil is every where found to be exceedingly
productive, and was originally covered with immense
forests of stately timber. Among its more ample productions
are grain, cotton, sugar, and excellent fruits&mdash;oranges,
figs, the olive, and the grape&mdash;as well as the singular vegetable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_876" id="Page_876">[Pg 876]</a></span>
called <i>matte</i>, so extensively used in South America as
a tea or beverage.</p>

<p><i>Insurrections and attempts at Revolution in the early
part of the Eighteenth Century.</i>&mdash;Paraguay is rendered
remarkable by several projects, more than a century ago,
having in view its independence, and, what is more wonderful,
by the open and public assertion, at that time, of the
principle, that the authority of the people was greater than
that of the king himself. Thus was anticipated, in a colony
of the most bigoted and despotic court of Europe, more
than a hundred years ago, the modern liberal doctrine of
the sovereignty of the people. The attempts referred to
were made by individuals, who had, perhaps, their private
causes of grievance, as Antequera, Mompo, and Mena,
though one of them, certainly, Mompo, was the preacher
of the doctrine above stated. No real independence, however,
was effected, except for a short period. The revolutionary
leaders were soon overcome in battle, put to death,
or banished, and the authority of the king of Spain was
rëestablished, and continued for the greater part of a century.</p>

<p><i>Establishment of Independence, and a Despotic Government.</i>&mdash;In
1810, the junta of Buenos Ayres sent a body of
troops to Paraguay to depose the Spanish governor, but
they were compelled to retreat. The inhabitants, however,
themselves deposed the governor, and took the government
into their own hands. In 1813, they proclaimed
Paraguay a republic, under two consuls, the principal of
which was Dr. Jose Gaspar Rodriguez de Francia. At the
end of the year, Francia caused himself to be named dictator
for three years, and, at the close of this term, for life.
On the 24th of September, 1826, a formal declaration of
independence was made, though the country, for fourteen
or fifteen years, had been governed independently of Spain.</p>

<p>The administration of Dr. Francia proved to be an
absolute and perfect despotism, and that of a most severe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_877" id="Page_877">[Pg 877]</a></span>
and sanguinary character. He was a native of Paraguay,
and received the degree of doctor of theology at the University
of Cordova, in Tucuman. For nearly thirty years
he acted the tyrant over the inhabitants of the country, and
brought the entire mass into the most unresisting subserviency
to his will. No personage has figured so conspicuously
as Dr. Francia, in the modern history of South
America. When, by consummate address, he had succeeded
in getting himself appointed dictator for life, commenced
one of the most extraordinary events on record.
"From the moment when he found his footing firm, and his
authority quietly submitted to, his whole character appeared
to undergo a sudden change. Without faltering or hesitation&mdash;without
a pause of human weakness, or a thrill of
human feeling&mdash;he proceeded to frame the most extraordinary
despotism that the world has ever seen. He reduced
all the population of Paraguay to two classes; of which the
dictator constituted one, and his subjects the other. In the
dictator was lodged the whole power, legislative and executive;
the people had no power, no privileges, no rights,
and only one duty, to obey. All was performed rapidly,
boldly, and decisively. He knew the character of the
weak and ignorant people at whose head he had placed
himself, and who had the temerity to presume that they had
energy and virtue sufficient to form a republic. The
inhabitants of Paraguay delivered themselves up, bound
hand and foot, into the hands of an absolute and ferocious
despot, who reduced them to absolute slavery, ruined their
commerce and agriculture, shut them up from the rest of
the world, and dragged to the prison or the scaffold every
man in the country whose talents, wealth, or knowledge
opposed any obstacle in the way of his tyranny. No
human being was allowed to leave the country, or dispatch
a letter abroad." A few only escaped, by means of the
flooding of the country by the rise of the river Paraguay,
and from these individuals the world has learned respecting
the secrets of this more than Dionysian espionage and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_878" id="Page_878">[Pg 878]</a></span>
tyranny. No attempted conspiracies availed to secure his
person or destroy his life. He managed so as to gain over
his soldiers entirely to his interests. As was to be expected,
he lived in constant fear of assassination or poisoning,
ordering his guards sometimes to shoot those who dared to
look at his house in passing along the streets, and taking the
trouble to cook his own victuals. He died at about the age
of eighty, in 1842, having thus enacted the despot during
the long course of twenty-eight years.</p>

<p>The wonder of all is, that the people generally were
contented and happy under this strict and unnatural regime;
yet it is partly to be accounted for from the entire security
of person and property which was felt, so far as the intercourse
of the people among themselves was concerned.
Each district was made responsible for every theft committed
in it. All the inhabitants, Indians as well as Creoles,
were taught to read, write, and keep accounts. Public
schools were every where established, and children were
required to attend them, until, in the judgment of the
municipal authority, they were sufficiently instructed. The
dictator also established lyceums and other liberal institutions.
Every person was required to labor, and mendicity
was prohibited. It has been represented, however, that
there was a mitigation of the doctor's despotism, in the
latter part of his life.</p>

<p>According to the more recent accounts, the government
of this country was administered by five consuls; but this
and the other matters pertaining to Paraguay, are very
imperfectly known, as the country has, for so long a period,
been avoided by foreigners.</p>

<p><i>Situation</i>, <i>Extent</i>, <i>Climate</i>, <i>Productions</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i>&mdash;The West
Indies constitute the great archipelago of the western continent,
extending from latitude ten to twenty-eight degrees
north, between the coast of Florida on the north, and the
mouth of the river Orinoco in South America. They
are a large cluster of islands, in their several portions
variously denominated, according to their situations or
other peculiarities, but will here be considered in their
political divisions. The land area of the whole group is
over ninety-three thousand square miles.</p>

<p>These islands have a general sameness of character, in
some respects, from the position which they occupy on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_880" id="Page_880">[Pg 880]</a></span>
face of the globe. The climate, as is to be expected, is
generally very warm, though moderated and made comfortable,
for the most part, by sea breezes. The thermometer
frequently rises above ninety degrees; but its medium
height maybe stated at about seventy-eight degrees of
Fahrenheit. They are visited by periodical rains, which
are often powerful, and in general the humidity of the
atmosphere is very great, causing iron and other metals
that are easily oxydated, to be covered with rust. Hurricanes
are common to most of these islands, and frequently,
in their incredible fury, produce the most desolating effects
wherever they extend.</p>

<p>The productions of the West Indies are rich and varied,
and constitute important articles of commerce. From the
fertile soil spring the sugar-cane, the coffee-plant, the allspice
or pimento, the nutritive banana or plantain, the pineapple,
the luscious fruit of the anana, the yam, sweet potato,
uca, maize, and cassava or manioc, with cocoa, tobacco,
cotton, various dye-woods and stuffs (fustic, logwood, indigo,
cochineal), and medicinal plants; such as arrow-root, liquorice-root,
ginger, jalap, ipecacuanha, sarsaparilla, &amp;c.; the
mahogany and lignum-vitæ are included in the vegetable
productions of this archipelago; but to this catalogue must
still be added the bread-fruit, cocoa-nut, mango, papaw,
guava, orange, lemon, tamarind, fig, cashew-nut, mammee,
grenadilla, panilla, panda-nut, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Inhabitants.</i>&mdash;The white inhabitants of the West Indies
are Creoles, Spanish, English, French, Germans, &amp;c.; but
the negroes are the most numerous class, though the mixed
races are quite abundant. The Indians are extinct, except
as mingled with negroes in a part of the island of St. Vincent.
The general classes are those of master and slave,
or were such before the act of emancipation took effect in
the British portion of the islands. From the diversity of
nations or races, several languages are necessarily in use,
as the English, the French, the Spanish, with other European<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_881" id="Page_881">[Pg 881]</a></span>
tongues, and the Creole, a jargon used in Hayti, composed
of French and several African dialects.</p>

<p><i>Political Divisions.</i>&mdash;These consist of the British islands,
the Spanish islands, the French islands, the Dutch islands,
the Danish islands, one Swedish island, and the independent
island of Hayti. The British own twenty-two islands, of
various dimensions; the Spanish, two, viz: the large islands
of Cuba and Porto Rico; the French, six; the Dutch, four;
and the single Swedish island is St. Bartholomews. The
last is a small, but fertile, island, which was ceded to Sweden
by France in 1785.</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">British West Indies.</span>&mdash;The government of the British
West Indies is modeled on the constitution of the mother-country.
The several islands have a governor or lieutenant-governor,
and a legislative council appointed by the crown;
and the most of them have also a house of representatives,
chosen by the people, who legislate upon all subjects of a
local character.</p>

<p>The West Indies were formerly a great mart of that
infamous traffic, the slave-trade, which, according to M'Culloch,
was commenced by the Portuguese in 1542, and this
nation seems disposed to be the last to relinquish it. By
means of the noble exertions of Wilberforce, Clarkson,
Sharp, and others, an act was passed in 1806 by the British
parliament for abolishing the slave-trade; and the present
age has witnessed another act highly honorable to the British
nation, for the total abolition of slavery, at great expense,
throughout the British colonies. By this memorable act,
which was passed by parliament in 1833, the slaves were on
the 1st of August, 1834, made apprenticed laborers to continue
such, a part of them till the 1st of August, 1838, and a
part till the 1st of August, 1840, when they were all to
become completely free. To indemnify the owners of the
slaves, parliament voted the sum of twenty millions pounds, as
a compensation, payable in certain fixed proportions, according<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_882" id="Page_882">[Pg 882]</a></span>
as each colony should be ascertained to have complied
with the terms of the act.</p>

<p>Soon after the passing of this act, the slaves in the island
of Antigua and the Bermudas were made free by the colonial
governments, and acts were afterwards passed by the legislatures
of Barbadoes, Jamaica, Nevis, Montserrat, St. Christopher's,
St. Vincent, and Tortola, liberating all the slaves
or apprenticed laborers in those islands on the 1st of August,
1838. Movements of a similar nature also, about the same
time, took place in the other islands, bringing to a close the
apprenticeship which had been established.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>A few of the more important British islands will be noticed
separately in a brief manner.</p>

<p>1. <i>Jamaica.</i>&mdash;This island was discovered by Columbus
in his second voyage in 1494. It was first settled by the
Spaniards in 1509. A body of seventy men were sent to
it by Diego Columbus, the son of the discoverer. These
were blood-thirsty wretches, who made frequent assaults on
the natives, for the purpose of robbery or revenge. The
progress of settlement was extremely slow&mdash;not more than
three thousand inhabitants, of whom half were slaves, being
found on the island in 1655, when it was taken by a British
force, under Penn and Venables.</p>

<p>Soon after this event, Jamaica was colonized by three
thousand soldiers, disbanded from the parliamentary army,
who were followed by about one thousand five hundred
royalists. At the period of its capture by the English,
many of the slaves belonging to the Spanish settlers fled to
the mountains, where they long lived in a kind of savage
independence, and became troublesome to the British colonists.
They have been known by the name of <i>Maroons</i>.
In 1795 they were overcome by the English, as they
descended from their fastnesses for the purpose of assaulting
the former, and six hundred of them were sent to Nova<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_883" id="Page_883">[Pg 883]</a></span>
Scotia, where they were settled on locations of land provided
for them by the government. Since the occupancy
of the island in 1655, the English have firmly maintained
their authority over it.</p>

<p>2. <i>Trinidad.</i>&mdash;This is a fruitful island, producing cotton,
sugar, fine tobacco, indigo, ginger, maize, and various fruits.
Its area is nearly two thousand square miles, and its population
over forty-five thousand. Its climate is unhealthy.
This island was taken by Sir Walter Raleigh in 1595, and
by the French in 1676. It was captured from the Spaniards
in 1797, and ceded to England by the treaty of Amiens
in 1802.</p>

<p>3. <i>Barbadoes.</i>&mdash;This island is situated on the eastern
border of the West Indian archipelago. It has a large
population for its size, numbering over one hundred thousand
souls, on an area of less than two hundred square
miles. The climate is hot, but the air is pure, and moderated
by the constant trade-winds, which render it salubrious,
in comparison with the other islands. The exports from the
island are sugar, rum, ginger, cotton, aloes, &amp;c. It is subject
to tempests, which at times have occasioned great
devastation and loss of life.</p>

<p>Barbadoes is supposed to have been discovered by the
Portuguese, and appears never to have had any aboriginal
inhabitants. In 1627, some English families settled there,
but without any authority from the government. It was
soon afterwards supplied with a regular colony by the Earl
of Carlisle. The British settlers at length brought this
rich, but uncultivated, track into entire subjection by the
power of industry.</p>

<p>4. <i>Bahamas.</i>&mdash;The Bahama or Lucayos islands consist
of about seven hundred very small islands, extending over
a large space of the archipelago on its northern border.
Their soil is generally light and sandy, and productive only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_884" id="Page_884">[Pg 884]</a></span>
in a few places. The principal products are cotton, salt,
turtle, fruits, mahogany, and dye-woods. The group among
them called Turk's island, is famous for its salt ponds, which
annually yield more than thirty thousand tons of salt for
the foreign market.</p>

<p>Guanahani, or Cat island, is celebrated as being the land
which Columbus first discovered. He named it San Salvador.
The Spaniards first settled on these islands, but at
length abandoned them, having shipped off the natives to
work in the mines in other places. They remained desolate
for more than a century. In 1629, New Providence
was taken possession of by the English, who remained
there till 1641, when they were driven out by the Spaniards
in a cruel and barbarous manner. They, however, changed
owners repeatedly, till, in 1783, they were confirmed to the
English by treaty. For many years previous to the close
of the American war, the Bahamas were the haunts of
pirates, buccaniers, and freebooters.</p>

<p>5. <i>St. Christopher's.</i>&mdash;This island, with Montserrat, Nevis,
Antigua, and the Virgin isles, form one government, the
governor generally residing at Antigua. The interior of the
country is a rugged mass of precipices and barren mountains,
the loftiest rising to three thousand seven hundred and ten
feet. The island has a productive soil on the plains.</p>

<p>St. Christopher's is said to have been the nursery of all
the English and French colonies in the West Indies. It
was first visited by both nations on the same day, in 1625.
They shared the island between them, engaging, by treaty,
to observe perpetual neutrality and alliance against the
Spaniards, the common enemy. The possession of a common
property in the productions of the island, led eventually
to jealousies and contentions. Whenever war broke out
between the mother-countries, the colonists engaged among
themselves, and alternately drove each other from the
plantations; but the treaty of Utrecht confirmed the British
in the possession of the whole island.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_885" id="Page_885">[Pg 885]</a></span></p>

<p>6. <i>Bermudas.</i>&mdash;The Bermudas, or Sommers' islands, consist
of a cluster of small islands in the ocean, opposite the
coast of North Carolina, about two hundred leagues distant.
They number about four hundred, but most of them
are of no importance. A few of them have numerous
forests, which supply timber for ship-building, thus giving
employment to the inhabitants, in connection with navigation.
The climate is healthful and pleasant, and the fields
and trees are clad in perpetual green. Their population is
nearly nine thousand. These islands were first discovered
in 1522, by Juan Bermudez, a Spaniard, who found them
without inhabitants. From him they received the name by
which they are generally known. They were also called
Sommers, from the circumstance that Sir George Sommers
was wrecked on them, in 1609. Shortly after this event,
the islands were settled by the English, who have retained
possession of them ever since.</p>

<p>7. <i>St. Vincent.</i>&mdash;St. Vincent is a rugged and elevated
island, of small extent, but extremely fertile, and well
adapted to the cultivation of sugar and indigo.</p>

<p>This island was first colonized, in 1719, by the French,
from Martinique. They had no small difficulty, even at
that late period, in bringing the fierce Carib natives under
their authority. It was obtained by the British, at the
peace of 1763, and, though afterwards subjected to the
French arms, it was, in 1783, again confirmed to the British.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">Spanish West Indies.</span>&mdash;Although Spain had the
honor of first ascertaining the existence of the West Indian
islands, and enjoyed the privilege of settling and holding
most of them for a time, yet they have all passed from her
authority, except two, Cuba and Porto Rico. Cuba, however,
is by far the largest of the group, having an extent
of territory equal to nearly one-half of the land area of
the entire archipelago.&mdash;The exports of these islands consist
of sugar, rum, molasses, coffee, tobacco, and cigars, with
honey, hides, cotton, fruits, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_886" id="Page_886">[Pg 886]</a></span></p>

<p>1. <i>Cuba.</i>&mdash;This island, as being the largest, is, in many
respects, the most important in the whole cluster of the
islands of the American continent. "During the last fifty
years, a concurrence of circumstances has rendered Cuba
the richest of the European colonies in any part of the
globe; a more liberal and protecting policy has been
adopted by the mother-country; the ports of the island
have been thrown open; strangers and emigrants have been
encouraged to settle there; and, amid the political agitations
of Spain, the expulsion of the Spanish and French residents
from Hispaniola, the cession of Louisiana and Florida to a
foreign power, and the disasters of those who, in the continental
states of America, adhered to the old country,
Cuba has become a place of general refuge." Its growth
and increase, within the above-named period, have been
very great. By the census of 1831, it contained eight hundred
and thirty thousand inhabitants. The value of its
exports, in 1833, was nearly fourteen millions of dollars;
that of its imports, eighteen millions and a half. In 1838,
the government of Spain levied a subsidy of two millions
five hundred thousand dollars on the island, to assist in
defraying the expense of the civil war. These facts denote
a state of things which formerly was far from existing on
this island.</p>

<p>Cuba was discovered by Columbus in his first voyage;
but he did not ascertain whether it was an island or a part
of the continent. The question was not determined until
some years afterwards. It was conquered by the Spaniards,
under Velasquez, in 1511. Little progress was made
in the settlement of the island till 1519, when it was found
that the most convenient route between Mexico and Europe
would be through the Bahama channel, and it was desirable
to possess a sea-port on the passage. This led to the
foundation of Havana, the harbor of which is the best in
the world. Cuba has ever been a Spanish colony.</p>

<p>2. <i>Porto Rico.</i>&mdash;This island is somewhat large for one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_887" id="Page_887">[Pg 887]</a></span>
of the West Indian cluster, having four thousand five hundred
square miles. It possesses a great variety of surface,
mountains, hills, and valleys. Its climate and productions
are similar to those of the adjacent islands.</p>

<p>Porto Rico was discovered by Columbus in 1493, but the
Spaniards made no attempt to settle it till 1509, when the
pursuit after gold carried them thither from Hispaniola,
under the command of Ponce de Leon. The natives,
impressed by the belief of the superior nature of the
Spaniards, made no resistance, but submitted to the yoke
of bondage. Subsequently, they made an insurrection, and
massacred a hundred of the invaders; but they were
easily subdued, as soon as the Spaniards received rëinforcements
from St. Domingo. Condemned to the mines, the
wretched natives all finally disappeared from among the
living. This island was taken by the English towards the
close of the seventeenth century, but they found the climate
so unhealthy, that they abandoned the conquest. It is now,
with Cuba, under the government of a captain-general, who
resides at Havana.</p>

<p>III. <span class="smcap">French West Indies.</span>&mdash;The French, at present,
possess but few of the islands of this Western main, having
lost some of their most important ones, as the result of
oppression or warfare. Of those that remain to them, two
are of some consequence.</p>

<p>1. <i>Martinique.</i>&mdash;This island is about fifty miles long and
sixteen broad. It has an uneven surface, and, in some
instances, mountainous eminences. Sugar, coffee, cassia,
cotton, indigo, cocoa, and ginger, are among its principal
productions.</p>

<p>This island was settled by the French in 1635. The
British took it in 1794; it was restored to France in 1802.
It changed hands again in 1809, but was finally restored to
France in 1815.</p>

<p>2. <i>Guadaloupe.</i>&mdash;This island is somewhat extensive, being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_888" id="Page_888">[Pg 888]</a></span>
seventy miles long, and twenty-five broad at its widest
part. In many parts, it has a rich soil, and among its productions
are enumerated sugar, coffee, rum, ginger, cocoa,
logwood, &amp;c. It has been repeatedly captured by the
British, and as often restored to France.</p>

<p>IV. <span class="smcap">Dutch West Indies</span>.&mdash;The Dutch possess four islands
in the West Indian group, viz: Curaçoa, St. Eustatius, St.
Martin, and Saba. <i>Curaçoa</i> was first possessed by the
Spaniards, in 1527. It was taken by the Dutch in 1634.
It is an island of thirty miles in length and ten in breadth.
Its chief productions are sugar and tobacco, but its soil is not
of the best quality, and for its supply of water it is dependent
on the rains. St. Eustatius is said to be one of the
finest and best-cultivated islands of all the Caribbees. Its
chief product is tobacco. The English captured the island
in 1801, but restored it to the Dutch in 1814.</p>

<p>V. <span class="smcap">Danish West Indies</span>.&mdash;These islands are three in
number, viz: St. Croix, St. John, and St. Thomas. They
are all small, the largest, St. Croix, having only eighty
square miles. St. John is celebrated for its fine and capacious
harbor. It has a number of salt ponds. St. Croix
has a salubrious climate and fertile soil. Every part of it
is under the highest cultivation. The Danes first obtained
possession of these islands, and still retain them.</p>

<p>VI. <span class="smcap">Independent Island</span>, <i>Hayti</i>.&mdash;The island of Hayti,
which now forms an independent negro republic, was formerly
called St. Domingo and Hispaniola&mdash;St. Domingo,
from the name of its chief city, and which became its common
appellation in Europe; Hispaniola, meaning <i>little
Spain</i>, so called by Columbus. Hayti is its original name,
and, after a lapse of three hundred years, has been revived
since the revolution. The island belonged, the western
part of it, to France, and the eastern to Spain. It is the
second in size of the West India islands, having an area of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_889" id="Page_889">[Pg 889]</a></span>
about thirty thousand square miles. It is traversed by
mountains in two chains, from east to west, with several
collateral branches, from which the rivers pour over the
plains below.</p>

<p>Besides the tropical fruits and vegetables which this
region affords, Hayti abounds with many valuable kinds of
wood. The mahogany is of a superior quality, and a
species of oak affords planks sixty or seventy feet long.
The pine is also abundant in the mountains. The annual
value of exports is about four millions of dollars, the principal
article being coffee, with mahogany, campeachy-wood,
cotton, tobacco, hides, cacas, tortoise-shell, wax,
ginger, &amp;c.</p>

<p>This island was discovered by Columbus in his first voyage,
and became early the scene of many an adventure, as
the civilized European mingled with the native Carib. In
the course of about half a century, however, from the time
of their settlement here, the Spaniards exterminated the
whole native population, estimated at more than two millions.
They remained undisputed masters of the island till
1630, when some English and French, who had been driven
out of St. Christopher's, took refuge there, and established
themselves on the northern coast. The French finally
obtained a firm footing on the island, and, after many ineffectual
attempts on the part of the Spanish government to
expel them, were, by the treaty of Ryswick, in 1691, formally
confirmed in the possession of the western half of
Hayti. The French portion of the island became, at
length, the far most important part of it in productiveness
and wealth.</p>

<p>The convulsions in France, in the latter part of the last
century, reached to this, its distant and beautiful colony.
The doctrines of liberty and independence had begun to
affect the minds of the blacks, who constituted seven-eighths
of the population. They soon became ripe for a rebellion,
which accordingly broke out in 1791, in the French portion
of Hayti. On the 1st of July, 1801, the independence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_890" id="Page_890">[Pg 890]</a></span>
this island was proclaimed, the celebrated Toussiant L'Ouverture
being at that time the leader. Toussiant died in
1803, and the command devolved upon Dessalines, one of
the chiefs, who was appointed governor for life; but afterwards
assumed, in 1804, the title of Jacques I., Emperor of
Hayti. His tyrannical reign was terminated by assassination
in 1806. Christophe, the second in command, assumed
the administration of affairs; in 1807, he was appointed
chief-magistrate for life, and, in 1811, he assumed the title
of King Henry I. But he found a formidable rival in
Petion, who possessed himself of the south part of the
island, which was formed into a republic, of which he was,
in 1816, appointed president for life.</p>

<p>Petion died in 1818, and was succeeded by Boyer, as
president for life. Two years afterwards, the subjects of
Christophe, wearied with his tyranny, revolted, and he,
being deserted by his troops, shot himself. Upon this
event, Boyer marched with an army to the north; and, after
a feeble resistance from a portion of the royalist chiefs, was
received as a deliverer by the people, and the two states
became united under one republic. There was little difficulty
in the undertaking, as the people, who were principally
colored, revolted against the Spanish authorities, and
received Boyer as their friend. The Spanish soldiers were
removed from the island, and the work of emancipation
was completely effected. From that period, the authority
of the blacks has been extended over the whole of Hayti.</p>

<p>In 1825, April 17th, a treaty was concluded between
France and Hayti, by which the independence of the latter
was acknowledged, on condition of receiving one hundred
and fifty millions of francs, to be paid in five annual
instalments. On the 1st of February, 1838, a new treaty
of peace was concluded at Port-au-Prince, between this
republic and the kingdom of France. The balance due
from Hayti to France was fixed at sixty millions of francs,
to be paid by annual instalments, from 1838 to 1863.</p>

<h6>OF THE</h6>

<h2>UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.</h2>



<p>WE THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES, in order to form a more perfect Union, establish
justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare,
and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this
Constitution for the United States of America.</p>



<h4>ARTICLE I.</h4>


<p><i>Section</i> 1. All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States,
which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.</p>

<p><i>Section</i> 2. The House of Representatives shall be composed of members chosen every second year
by the people of the several states, and the electors in each state shall have the qualifications requisite
for electors of the most numerous branch of the state legislature.</p>

<p>No person shall be a representative who shall not have attained to the age of twenty-five years, and
been seven years a citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an inhabitant of
that state in which he shall be chosen.</p>

<p>Representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several states which may be included
within this Union, according to their respective numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the
whole number of free persons, including those bound to service for a term of years, and excluding Indians
not taxed, three-fifths of all other persons. The actual enumeration shall be made within three years
after the first meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within every subsequent term of ten years,
in such manner as they shall by law direct. The number of representatives shall not exceed one for every
thirty thousand, but each state shall have at least one representative; and until such enumeration shall
be made, the state of New Hampshire shall be entitled to chuse three, Massachusetts eight, Rhode Island
and Providence Plantations one, Connecticut five, New York six, New Jersey four, Pennsylvania eight,
Delaware one, Maryland six, Virginia ten, North Carolina five, South Carolina five, and Georgia three.</p>

<p>When vacancies happen in the representation from any state, the executive authority thereof shall
issue writs of election to fill such vacancies.</p>

<p>The House of Representatives shall chuse their Speaker and other officers; and shall have the sole
power of impeachment.</p>

<p><i>Section</i> 3. The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two senators from each state,
chosen by the legislature thereof, for six years; and each senator shall have one vote.</p>

<p>Immediately after they shall be assembled in consequence of the first election, they shall be divided
as equally as may be into three classes. The seats of the senators of the first class shall be vacated at
the expiration of the second year, of the second class at the expiration of the fourth year, and of the
third class at the expiration of the sixth year, so that one-third may be chosen every second year; and
if vacancies happen, by resignation, or otherwise, during the recess of the legislature of any state, the
executive thereof may make temporary appointments until the next meeting of the legislature, which
shall then fill such vacancies.</p>

<p>No person shall be a senator who shall not have attained to the age of thirty years, and been nine
years a citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an inhabitant of that state for
which he shall be chosen.</p>

<p>The Vice-President of the United States shall be President of the Senate, but shall have no vote,
unless they be equally divided.</p>

<p>The Senate shall chuse their other officers, and also a President <i>pro tempore</i>, in the absence of the
Vice-President, or when he shall exercise the office of President of the United States.</p>

<p>The Senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments. When sitting for that purpose, they
shall be on oath or affirmation. When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall
preside: and no person shall be convicted without the concurrence of two-thirds of the members present.</p>

<p>Judgment in cases of impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from office, and disqualification
to hold and enjoy any office of honour, trust or profit under the United States: but the party
convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to indictment, trial, judgment and punishment,
according to law.</p>

<p><i>Section</i> 4. The times, places and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives, shall
be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by law make
or alter such regulations, except as to the places of chusing senators.</p>

<p>The Congress shall assemble at least once in every year, and such meeting shall be on the first
Monday in December, unless they shall by law appoint a different day.</p>

<p><i>Section</i> 5. Each House shall be the judge of the elections, returns and qualifications of its own
members, and a majority of each shall constitute a quorum to do business; but a smaller number may
adjourn from day to day, and may be authorized to compel the attendance of absent members, in such
manner and under such penalties as each House may provide.</p>

<p>Each House may determine the rules of its proceedings, punish its members for disorderly behaviour
and, with the concurrence of two-thirds, expel a member.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_892" id="Page_892">[Pg 892]</a></span></p>

<p>Each House shall keep a journal of its proceedings, and from time to time publish the same, excepting
such parts as may in their judgment require secrecy; and the yeas and nays of the members of either
House on any question shall, at the desire of one-fifth of those present, be entered on the journal.</p>

<p>Neither House, during the session of Congress, shall, without the consent of the other, adjourn for
more than three days, nor to any other place than that in which the two Houses shall be sitting.</p>

<p><i>Section</i> 6. The senators and representatives shall receive a compensation for their services, to be
ascertained by law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States. They shall in all cases, except
treason, felony, and breach of the peace, be privileged from arrest during their attendance at the session
of their respective Houses, and in going to and returning from the same; and for any speech or debate in
either House, they shall not be questioned in any other place.</p>

<p>No senator or representative shall, during the time for which he was elected, be appointed to any
civil office under the authority of the United States, which shall have been created, or the emoluments
whereof shall have been increased during such time; and no person holding any office under the United
States, shall be a member of either House during his continuance in office.</p>

<p><i>Section</i> 7. All bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives; but the
Senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other bills.</p>

<p>Every bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it
become a law, be presented to the President of the United States; if he approve he shall sign it, but if
not he shall return it, with his objections to that House in which it shall have originated, who shall enter
the objections at large on their journal, and proceed to reconsider it. If after such reconsideration two-thirds
of that House shall agree to pass the bill, it shall be sent, together with the objections, to the other
House, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered, and if approved by two-thirds of that House, it shall
become a law. But in all such cases the votes of both Houses shall be determined by yeas and nays,
and the names of the persons voting for and against the bill shall be entered on the journal of each
house respectively. If any bill shall not be returned by the President within ten days (Sundays excepted)
after it shall have been presented to him, the same shall be a law, in like manner as if he had signed it,
unless the Congress by their adjournment prevent its return, in which case it shall not be a law.</p>

<p>Every order, resolution, or vote to which the concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives
may be necessary (except on a question of adjournment) shall be presented to the President of the United
States; and before the same shall take effect, shall be approved by him, or being disapproved by him,
shall be repassed by two-thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives, according to the rules and
limitations prescribed in the case of a bill.</p>

<p><i>Section</i> 8. The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises, to
pay the debts and provide for the common defence and general welfare of the United States; but all
duties, imposts and excises shall be uniform throughout the United States;&mdash;To borrow money on the

<p>No person held to service or labour in one state, under the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall,

amendments to this Constitution, or, on the application of the legislatures of two-thirds of the several
states, shall call a convention for proposing amendments, which, in either case, shall be valid to all intents
and purposes, as part of this Constitution, when ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several
states, or by convention in three-fourths thereof, as the one or the other mode of ratification may be proposed
by the Congress; Provided that no amendment which may be made prior to the year one thousand
eight hundred and eight shall in any manner affect the first and fourth clauses in the ninth section of the
first article; and that no state, without its consent, shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the Senate.</p>

<p>ARTICLE VI.&mdash;All debts contracted and engagements entered into, before the adoption of this Constitution,
shall be as valid against the United States under this Constitution, as under the Confederation.</p>

<p>This Constitution, and the laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof; and
all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme
law of the land; and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, any thing in the constitution or
laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.</p>

<p>The senators and representatives before mentioned, and the members of the several state legislatures,
and all executive and judicial officers, both of the United States and of the several states, shall be bound
by oath or affirmation, to support this Constitution; but no religious test shall ever be required as a
qualification to any office or public trust under the United States.</p>

<p>ARTICLE VII.&mdash;The ratification of the Conventions of nine states, shall be sufficient for the establishment
of this Constitution between the states so ratifying the same.</p>

<h2><a name="DECLARATION_OF_INDEPENDENCE" id="DECLARATION_OF_INDEPENDENCE">DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE.</a></h2>



<p>When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary
for one people to dissolve the political bands which
have connected them with another, and to assume, among
the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to
which the laws of nature and of nature's God entitle them,
a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that
they should declare the causes which impel them to the
separation.</p>

<p>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are
created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator
with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That, to secure
these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving
their just powers from the consent of the governed;
and that, whenever any form of government becomes
destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to
alter or abolish it, and to institute new government, laying
its foundations on such principles, and organizing its powers
in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect
their safety and happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate
that governments, long established, should not be changed
for light and transient causes; and, accordingly, all experience
hath shown that mankind are more disposed to
suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves
by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_898" id="Page_898">[Pg 898]</a></span>
But, when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing
invariably the same object, evinces a design to reduce them
under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty,
to throw off such government, and to provide new guards
for their future security. Such has been the patient sufferance
of the colonies, and such is now the necessity
which constrains them to alter their former systems of
government. The history of the present king of Great
Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations,
all having, in direct object, the establishment of an absolute
tyranny over these states. To prove this, let facts be
submitted to a candid world:</p>

<p>He has refused his assent to laws the most wholesome
and necessary for the public good.</p>

<p>He has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate
and pressing importance unless suspended in their
operations till his assent should be obtained; and, when
so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.</p>

<p>He has refused to pass other laws for the accommodation
of large districts of people, unless those people would
relinquish the right of representation in the legislature; a
right inestimable to them, and formidable to tyrants only.</p>

<p>He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual,
uncomfortable, and distant from the repository of their
public records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into
compliance with his measures.</p>

<p>He has dissolved representative houses repeatedly, for
opposing, with manly firmness, his invasions on the rights
of the people.</p>

<p>He has refused, for a long time after such dissolutions,
to cause others to be elected; whereby the legislative powers,
incapable of annihilation, have returned to the people
at large for their exercise; the state remaining, in the mean
time, exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without,
and convulsions within.</p>

<p>He has endeavored to prevent the population of these
states; for that purpose obstructing the laws of naturalization
of foreigners, refusing to pass others to encourage their
migration thither, and raising the conditions of new appropriations
of lands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_899" id="Page_899">[Pg 899]</a></span></p>

<p>He has obstructed the administration of justice, by refusing
his assent to laws for establishing judiciary powers.</p>

<p>He has made judges dependent on his will alone, for the
tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of
their salaries.</p>

<p>He has erected a multitude of new offices, and sent
hither swarms of officers to harass our people, and eat out
their substance.</p>

<p>He has kept among us, in time of peace, standing
armies, without the consent of our legislatures.</p>

<p>He has affected to render the military independent of,
and superior to, the civil power.</p>

<p>He has combined with others, to subject us to a jurisdiction
foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by
our laws; giving his assent to their acts of pretended
legislation.</p>

<p>For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:</p>

<p>For protecting them, by a mock trial, from punishment
for any murders which they should commit on the inhabitants
of these states:</p>

<p>For cutting off our trade with all parts of the world:</p>

<p>For imposing taxes on us without our consent:</p>

<p>For depriving us, in many cases, of the benefit of trial
by jury:</p>

<p>For transporting us beyond seas to be tried for pretended
offences:</p>

<p>For abolishing the free system of English laws in a
neighboring province, establishing therein an arbitrary
government, and enlarging its boundaries so as to render it
at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the
same absolute rule into these colonies:</p>

<p>For taking away our charters, abolishing our most valuable
laws, and altering, fundamentally, the forms of our
governments:</p>

<p>For suspending our own legislatures, and declaring
themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all
cases whatsoever.</p>

<p>He has abdicated government here, by declaring us out
of his protection, and waging war against us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_900" id="Page_900">[Pg 900]</a></span></p>

<p>He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt
our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.</p>

<p>He is, at this time, transporting large armies of foreign
mercenaries to complete the works of death, desolation,
and tyranny, already begun, with circumstances of cruelty
and perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages,
and totally unworthy the head of a civilized nation.</p>

<p>He has constrained our fellow-citizens, taken captive on
the high seas, to bear arms against their country, to become
the executioners of their friends and brethren, or to fall
themselves by their hands.</p>

<p>He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and
has endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers
the merciless Indian savages, whose known rule of warfare
is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes,
and conditions.</p>

<p>In every stage of these oppressions, we have petitioned
for redress in the most humble terms. Our repeated petitions
have been answered only by repeated injury. A
prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which
may define a tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.</p>

<p>Nor have we been wanting in attentions to our British
brethren. We have warned them, from time to time, of
the attempts, by their legislature, to extend an unwarrantable
jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the
circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We
have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity,
and we have conjured them, by the ties of our common
kindred, to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably
interrupt our connections and correspondence. They,
too, have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity.
We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity
which denounces our separation, and hold them, as we
hold the rest of mankind, enemies in war, in peace, friends.</p>

<p>We, therefore, the Representatives of the United States
of America, in General Congress assembled, appealing to
the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our
intentions, do, in the name, and by the authority of the
good people of these colonies, solemnly publish and declare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_901" id="Page_901">[Pg 901]</a></span>
that these United Colonies are, and of right ought to be
free and independent States; that they are absolved from
all allegiance to the British crown, and that all political
connection between them and the state of Great Britain is,
and ought to be, totally dissolved; and that, as free and
independent States, they have full power to levy war, conclude
peace, contract alliances, establish commerce, and to
do all other acts and things which independent States may
of right do. And, for the support of this declaration, with
a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we
mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes, and
our sacred honor.</p>

<h2><a name="APPENDIX" id="APPENDIX">APPENDIX.</a></h2>

<h3>XVII. ZACHARY TAYLOR, PRESIDENT,</h3>

<p class="center">(CONTINUED FROM PAGE <a href="#Page_756">756</a>.)</p>


<p>Congress assembled on the 3d of December. But the
organization of the House of Representatives was delayed
for twenty days, that period being consumed in voting for a
Speaker, before a choice was effected. The ballotings
reached the number of sixty-three. So nearly balanced
were the two great political parties, that a few members,
constituting the "Free Soil Party," so called, had it in their
power for this long time to prevent a choice, and that power
they exercised with an obstinacy of purpose, which excited
the marvel of the nation. Nor, at the last, was a choice
effected but by the adoption of a novel resolution, viz., that
after voting <i>viva voce</i> three times, if no speaker is elected,
the vote shall be called again, and the member having the
highest vote, provided it be a majority of a quorum, shall be
declared elected. Under this rule the choice finally fell
upon the candidate of the democratic party.</p>

<p>To the people of the country, such a contest was regarded
with deep regret, and even with indignation. The feelings
of members became excited and exasperated; political
jealousies and animosities were kindled, sectional differences
were magnified to unwonted importance, and sectional interests
advocated and insisted upon, all giving premonition
of the long and stormy session which followed.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the President and Senate awaited the issue
with a calm and dignified bearing; and, on the organization
of the House, the former communicated his annual
Message. It was more brief than such documents have
usually been; but clear, able, and remarkably practical.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_903" id="Page_903">[Pg 903]</a></span>
It recommended among other matters of various moment,
an alteration of the Tariff&mdash;improvements in rivers and
harbors&mdash;strict neutrality of the nation in foreign quarrels&mdash;and
the immediate admission of California with the
Constitution which she had already formed. The message
concluded by urging the preservation of the Union, in terms
as noble in sentiment, as beautiful in expression. The
President said: "Attachment to the Union of the States,
should be habitually fostered in every American heart.
For more than half a century, during which kingdoms and
empires have fallen, this Union has stood unshaken. The
patriots who formed it, have long since descended to the
grave; yet still it remains, the proudest monument to their
memory, and the object of affection and admiration with
every one, worthy to bear the American name. In my
judgment, its dissolution would be the greatest of calamities;
and to avert that, should be the study of every American.
Upon its preservation must depend our own happiness,
and that of countless generations to come. What
ever dangers may threaten it, I shall stand by it, and
maintain it in its integrity to the full extent of the obligations
imposed, and the power conferred upon me by the
Constitution."</p>

<p><i>Proceedings in Congress.</i>&mdash;For years the subject of
slavery has been, as is well known, a fruitful theme of controversy,
and a source of jealousy and agitation, between
parties in the southern and northern states. The great
territorial acquisitions of the United States, consequent
upon the war with Mexico, and the question whether slavery
should or should not obtain in those territories, had
served to increase that jealousy and that agitation. Moreover,
California had already adopted a Constitution, by
which slavery was excluded, and was making application
for admission into the Union. Other states were soon
expected to follow her lead. To the South, these anti-slavery
tendencies were not only unexpected, but most unwelcome,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_904" id="Page_904">[Pg 904]</a></span>
as with the hope, and, probably, with the design of
extending the area of slavery, they had ardently enlisted in
the Mexican war. On the other hand, the people of the
North generally, were for preventing the further extension
of slavery, and even desired to curtail the system by all
constitutional measures within their power.</p>

<p>It was in this sensitive and excited state of the country
that Congress assembled. The members themselves participated
more or less in these jealous and antagonistical
feelings, which were rather increased than allayed by the
unfortunate contest attendant upon the election of a speaker.
Indeed, that a storm was approaching was too evident to be
concealed. A crisis had come which must be met. Questions
of the deepest importance could no longer be postponed.
It was fortunate for the nation, that the Senate at this time
embodied men of great political sagacity, and firm and
patriotic resolution. Among these may be mentioned, by
way of pre-eminence, Mr. Clay, who had once more
returned to the councils of the nation, and upon whom
more than any other man, it seemed to devolve, to mediate
between parties holding a hostile attitude, and to suggest
some measures, if such were possible, by which great and
daily increasing difficulties might be compromised.</p>

<p>Accordingly, towards the close of January, Mr. Clay
introduced his celebrated resolutions to the consideration of
the Senate, "by which, taken together, he proposed an amicable
arrangement of all the questions in controversy between
free and slave states, growing out of the subject of the institution
of Slavery." These resolutions were as follows.</p>

<p>The first of these related to the admission of California,
when she should apply, without providing for the introduction
or exclusion of Slavery within her boundaries. The
second declared that Slavery does not exist, and is not likely
to be introduced into the territories acquired from the
republic of Mexico; and that no legislation should be had
in reference to its introduction or exclusion therefrom.
The third established the western boundary in the state of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_905" id="Page_905">[Pg 905]</a></span>
Texas. The fourth provided for the payment of the public
debt of the State of Texas, she relinquishing to the United
States all her claims for any part of New Mexico. The
fifth asserted the inexpediency of abolishing slavery in the
District of Columbia, without the consent of Maryland,
without the consent of the people of the district, and without
just compensation to the owners of the slaves within
the district. The sixth expressed the expediency of prohibiting
the slave-trade in the District of Columbia. The
seventh related to the restitution and delivery of fugitive
slaves. The eighth denied the power to Congress, to prohibit
or obstruct the slave-trade between the slaveholding
states.</p>

<p>These resolutions were subsequently supported by Mr.
Clay in a speech of great power, and in which the great
pacificator stood before the Senate and the world as the
firm and fast friend of the country&mdash;the whole country, in
whose service, for whose prosperity, and for the preservation
of whose Union, he had labored with untiring assiduity
during the greater part of his life. In view of the dangers
which were thickening around the country and the prospect
of disunion, and possibly civil war growing out of these
unsettled questions, between the North and South, Mr.
Clay in conclusion, most eloquently said, "Sir, I implore
gentlemen, I adjure them, whether from the South or the
North, by all they hold dear in this world&mdash;by all their love
of liberty&mdash;by all their veneration for their ancestors&mdash;by
all their gratitude to Him, who has bestowed on them such
unnumbered and countless blessings&mdash;by all the duties which
they owe to mankind&mdash;and by all the duties which they
owe to themselves, to pause, solemnly to pause at the edge
of the precipice, before the fatal and dangerous leap is taken
into the yawning abyss below, from which none who ever
take it, shall return in safety."</p>

<p>From this time for months, these resolutions occupied the
consideration of the Senate&mdash;speech following speech&mdash;often
embodying the most profound views&mdash;exciting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_906" id="Page_906">[Pg 906]</a></span>
deepest feelings, and giving birth ofttime to eloquence the
most powerful and patriotic.</p>

<p><i>Death of Mr. Calhoun.</i>&mdash;During the pendency of these
great questions which were agitating the country to its remotest
ends, and the discussion of which seemed to increase
rather than allay the already excited storm, an event
occurred calculated to show the folly of all such sectional
strife, as that in which the Representatives of the nation
were engaged. This was the death of that able and distinguished
statesman, John C. Calhoun, of South Carolina,
who died at Washington, while a member of the Senate, on
the 6th of April. Among the great men of the day, few
had occupied a more commanding station than he, and but
few had been longer engaged in the public service of his
country. As early as 1810, Mr. Calhoun took his seat in
the House of Representatives of the United States. The
period was pregnant with portentous events. Europe was
involved in war, nor was it improbable that the United
States would long escape its calamities. Mr. Calhoun felt,
and enforced the necessity of immediate preparation for
such a state. The first tones of his voice in public life
might be considered war-like, yet no man loved peace better,
or deemed it more likely to be secured than by being
well prepared for hostilities. In subsequent years, he occupied
various important offices. During the administration
of the younger Adams, and the first term of Gen. Jackson,
he held the office of Vice President. During a part of the
Tyler Administration, he was Secretary of State. For
many years he had a seat in the Senate. In all these stations
he showed himself to be a man of pre-eminent talents
and incorruptible integrity. He was strongly southern in
his feelings, and perhaps his sectional prejudices sometimes
led him to the advocacy of some measures, and opposition
to others, which with other feelings he would have avoided.
Yet, no one could doubt his patriotism or his firmness in the
cause of right, as he understood it. His speeches displayed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_907" id="Page_907">[Pg 907]</a></span>
great logical acumen, and were often characterized for
great power and brilliancy, which commanded the admiration
of his strongest political opponents.</p>

<p>In the great questions which were agitating the national
representatives at the time of his death, Mr. Calhoun had
taken the deepest possible interest. He was solemnly impressed
with the critical juncture of affairs, and thought he
foresaw in the measures which were likely to be adopted, the
precursors of a shock fatal to the integrity of the National
Union. Though borne down with a disease which in the
sequel must prove fatal, he enlisted himself strongly&mdash;too
strongly for his physical strength, to avert impending calamities,
as he deemed them, and by so doing, hastened the
termination of his mortal existence.</p>

<p>His departure was a national loss. Even those who had
long differed from him in regard to political doctrines and
political measures, lamented his death. A committee of the
Senate accompanied his remains to his native state, where
it is believed he was held in honor and affection almost unequaled
in the history of public men.</p>

<p>The funeral obsequies of Mr. Calhoun having been solemnized,
Congress resumed its deliberations, and, shortly after,
a resolution introduced by Mr. Foote, referring the subject
matters in debate to a select committee, consisting of thirteen,
was adopted. Of this committee, Mr. Clay was chairman.
To this committee were referred the following subjects
upon which to report:</p>

<p>1st. The admission of California as she presents herself.
2d. Governments for territories without any anti-slavery
proviso. 3d. Settlement of the boundary question between
Texas and New Mexico, and the purchase of the territory
of Texas. 4th. The ultimate admission of other states,
formed from the territory of Texas. Besides these, the
committee were permitted to take into consideration or not,
at their discretion, the subject of fugitive slaves, and Slavery
in the District of Columbia.</p>

<p>On the 8th of May, Mr. Clay presented the majority<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_908" id="Page_908">[Pg 908]</a></span>
report of the Committee of thirteen, denominated the compromise
or omnibus bill, which after a protracted discussion
failed; but its provisions were subsequently passed, as we
shall have occasion to notice in a subsequent page.</p>

<p><i>Invasion of Cuba.</i>&mdash;On the 25th of April, and the 2d of
May, an expedition, three hundred in number, left New
Orleans, under command of Gen. Lopez, for the secret purpose
of invading Cuba. This force had been collected,
armed, and officered in the United States. So secretly had
the affair been conducted, that neither the Spanish Consuls
in our larger ports, nor the government of the United States
had been apprised of it. The invaders consisted in part of
old Mexican soldiers, some of whom were informed of the
object in view, while not a few enlisted under the expectation
that the expedition was bound to California. On the
morning of the 19th of May, a landing was effected at Cardenas.
A brief struggle ensued between the invaders and
the troops, in which the latter were repulsed, the Governor
captured, his palace plundered, and a large quantity of public
money seized. The invaders had counted upon accessions
to their ranks in the Spanish army, and from the
disaffected inhabitants. In this, however, they were disappointed,
and Lopez re-embarked on board the steamer, and
with a few of his followers made his escape to the United
States, leaving the great body of his adherents to the tender
mercies of the authorities of Cuba. As soon as the sailing
of the expedition was known, the American executive despatched
armed vessels to prevent its landing in Cuba. In
this, however, they failed. Lopez was arrested in New Orleans,
and held for trial. It seems that a Spanish steamer
captured two vessels in the Mexican waters, laden with men
whom they suspected of having intended to join the invading
expedition, and took them into Havanna. The release
of these was peremptorily demanded by the President, and
subsequently they were so released. But three, it is believed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_909" id="Page_909">[Pg 909]</a></span>
of all who participated in the invasion, were condemned, and
these three were sent to the galleys.</p>

<p><i>Convention with Great Britain.</i>&mdash;This Convention had
reference to the Nicaragua treaty, so called, which was ratified
by the governments of the United States and Great
Britain, and promulgated at Washington, the 4th of July,
1850. This treaty provided for the establishment of a communication
between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, by
means of a ship canal, to be constructed by way of the river
San Juan de Nicaragua, and either or both of the lakes of
Nicaragua or Maragua, to any port or place on the Pacific
Ocean.</p>

<p><i>Death of Gen. Taylor.</i>&mdash;The administration of Gen. Taylor
was suddenly brought to a close, on the 9th of July, by
his demise, on the evening of that day. His illness was
brief, and occasioned by exposure and fatigue, while attending
the celebration of the 4th of July. His funeral was
attended by a large military display, by the officers of government
and the representatives of foreign nations, and by
an immense concourse of his fellow citizens.</p>

<p>This event was unexpected, and the more so, from the
well known vigor of health always enjoyed by the President.
It came upon the nation, as in the case of the death of the
lamented Harrison, like the voice of an earthquake. Few
could credit it; none were prepared for it. That he, who
"had passed through severe military duties in the swamps
of Florida, and on the plains of Mexico, unharmed by bullet
or pestilence, should be struck down in the midst of his
friends, and in the high station to which his country had
raised him&mdash;it was thought passing strange."</p>

<p>In a former part of this work we have had occasion to
sketch a portion of the military service rendered by Gen.
Taylor, while in the employment of the Government. We
have seen with what courage, skill, and bravery he bore himself
at Palo Alto, Buena Vista, and on other fields, where
victories were achieved which would have done credit to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_910" id="Page_910">[Pg 910]</a></span>
Napoleon or a Wellington. During his entire military life,
in the midst of his most brilliant victories, in the flush of all
his military prosperity, he seems to have maintained an
unaffected simplicity of character, a remarkable plainness
of manners, an unbending integrity of soul, combined with
kindness, moderation, and benevolence, calculated to win
the admiration and confidence of all to whom he stood
related.</p>

<p>"Returning, laurel-crowned and victorious, from a foreign
war," as a writer remarks, "he was hailed from his first
landing on his native strand, as the future President. With
what unaffected modesty he received these new honors&mdash;how
scrupulously he abstained from any and every step
that might look like seeking this high office&mdash;how calmly and
how simply, when installed as President, he bore his honors,
we need not attempt to recite." From the day of his inauguration,
to the day of his death, it is believed that he
endeavored, as he expressed himself on his dying pillow, to
do his duty. No one, perhaps, ever suspected him of "pursuing
any crooked path in politics," or "having been actuated
by sinister views and purposes." His administration
was brief&mdash;only one year and four months&mdash;too brief to
decide upon the policy which he might have deemed it his
duty to pursue, in the difficult and trying times upon which
the government had fallen, and amidst the perplexing questions
which it was called to decide. It was fortunate for his
reputation, perhaps, that he was removed at the precise juncture
at which God called him to resign his exalted station.
He had committed no error. He stood before the nation
and the world, as the man of integrity&mdash;brilliant in his former
military exploits&mdash;firm and patriotic in his brief civil
career. He enjoyed the confidence of friends&mdash;he commanded
the respect and admiration of political opponents.
He died mourned and lamented by all. To what higher
honors could a man wish to attain? What reputation more
exalted, or more enviable, could he wish to leave behind
him? <i>Fortunate Senex</i>!</p>

<p>It is a most admirable feature of the Constitution of the
United States, that it provides, in case of the death of a
President, for the ready and quiet transfer of all his powers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_912" id="Page_912">[Pg 912]</a></span>
to the Vice President, as his constitutional successor. And
a most interesting hour was that when, on the day following
the death of Gen. Taylor, and while his remains were
still reposing in the national mansion, Mr. Fillmore took the
oath of the Presidential office in the presence of both Houses
of Congress. It was a service occupying but a brief space;
but in that short time a transfer of all executive power was
quietly effected, and the machinery of government, which
had paused for only a few hours, if it may be said to have
been suspended at all, was again in motion, and was proceeding
with its accustomed regularity and harmonious
action. How unlike to scenes in other nations of the world,
when the demise of a sovereign is nearly sure to be followed
by turmoil and confusion, and the transfer of his power
is effected only, perhaps, by strife and bloodshed. But here,
at the bidding of God, the President one hour puts off the
mantle of his power and authority, and the next his successor
assumes it, and not one wave of commotion is observed.
Who will not say of such a Constitution,&mdash;<i>Esto perpetua</i>?</p>

<p><i>The Compromise Bill.</i>&mdash;The death of Gen. Taylor, and
the funeral obsequies consequent thereupon, suspended for a
brief time all other Congressional proceedings of the National
Council. When, at length, action was resumed, it was
natural to expect that an event so providential and so monitory
would have its due influence in mitigating the acerbity
of party spirit, and of infusing into the minds of legislators
a deeper sense of the importance of harmony and mutual
kindness. But it proved otherwise. Scarcely had the
grave closed upon the remains of the great and good man, ere
the same heated contest was renewed, and the same sectional
jealousies indulged.</p>

<p>It would impart no pleasure to enter into the details of the
Senate's action, day after day, upon the Compromise bill,
the one great measure which had absorbed its dissensions
nearly the whole of the session. Suffice it to say, that in
consequence of various amendments, the bill, at length,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_913" id="Page_913">[Pg 913]</a></span>
contained nothing but the sections relating to the territory
of Utah, and in that shape it was passed by a vote of 32 to 18.
Thus a series of measures, which had been under discussion
for months, which the powerful eloquence of Clay, Cass,
and others had advocated, and which by them and others
was deemed almost essential to the peace and integrity of
the Union, was lost, and for the time any adequate substitute
seemed hopeless. Clouds of deeper intensity than ever
seemed to be gathering, and anarchy and discord were ready
to extend their baleful influence to the nation at large.</p>

<p>Happily, however, a conservative spirit at length prevailed.
Men perceived the necessity of doing something to
save the nation and the Union, and under this conviction,
a movement was made to revive, in another form and in
distinct bills, the measures which had been previously combined
into one, and been lost. We shall attempt to state
little more than results.</p>

<p>First, the bill for the admission of California was taken
up, and after a warm discussion, during which amendment
after amendment was offered and rejected, it was passed by
the Senate, 34 to 18. To this bill a formal and spirited
protest was presented by several southern Senators, but its
registration on the journal was refused.</p>

<p>Next, followed a bill making proposals to Texas for the
settlement of her western boundary, and proposing to pay
her ten millions of dollars, provided she should relinquish all
claim to the United States for territory beyond the boundaries
prescribed. The bill was debated for several days,
and on the 9th of September, received its final passage.
Yeas 30, nays 20.</p>

<p>On the 14th, the bill providing for a territorial government
for New Mexico, was taken up and finally passed.</p>

<p>The above several bills were sent of course to the House
of Representatives, and by that body were passed with
amendments with regard to some of them, but only after as
warm and even heated debate, as was ever, perhaps, known
on the floor of Congress.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_914" id="Page_914">[Pg 914]</a></span></p>

<p>Two other important bills received also the sanction of a
majority of both houses; the first was a bill to facilitate the
recovery of fugitive slaves; and the second, a bill abolishing
the slave trade in the District of Columbia.</p>

<p>Congress adjourned on the 30th of September; the session
having been protracted to the long period of ten
months, and having proved more stormy than any other
session since the adoption of the Federal Constitution. The
effects of the above measures time only can determine.
While to the South, the abolition of the slave trade in the
District of Columbia, is most obnoxious, being, as is affirmed,
a precursor of further action by the general government
in relation to the abolition of slavery, the fugitive
slave bill has received the loud and decided condemnation
of individuals and assemblies at the North. The opinion,
however, of the Attorney General, that this latter bill does
not suspend the writ of Habeas Corpus, has served in a
measure to allay the wide-spread hostility to it, as such suspension
was supposed to be contemplated by it, and was
condemned as unconstitutional and unjust.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> It gives an interesting view of the depth of Columbus' solicitude and grief,
as well as of the peculiar spirit by which he was actuated in his great enterprise,
to learn the following from his own pen, in a letter to his sovereign: "I could have supported this evil fortune with less grief, had my person alone been in
jeopardy, since I am debtor for my life to the Supreme Creator, and have at
other times been within a step of death. But it was a cause of infinite sorrow
and trouble to think, that after having been illuminated from on high with faith
and certainty to undertake this enterprise; after having victoriously achieved it,
and when on the point of convincing my opponents and securing to your highness
great glory and vast increase of dominion, it should please the Divine Majesty
to defeat all by my death. It would have been more supportable also, had I not
been accompanied by others, who had been drawn on by my persuasions, and
who in their distress cursed not only the hour of their coming, but the fear
inspired by my words, which prevented their turning back as they had at various
times determined. Above all, my grief was doubled when I thought of my two
sons, whom I had left in school at Cordova, destitute in a strange land, without
any testimony of the services rendered by their father, which, if known, might
have inclined your highness to befriend them. And although, on the one hand,
I was comforted by a faith, that the Deity would not permit a work of such
great exaltation to his church, wrought through so many troubles and contradictions,
to remain imperfect; yet, on the other hand, I reflected on my sins, for
which he might intend, as a punishment, that I should be deprived of the glory
which would redound to me in this world." It is ever to be kept in mind, that
Columbus had the most exalted ideas of the effect of his discoveries on the
extension of Christianity. Connected with this pious motive, was the questionable
one of consecrating the wealth hence to be derived to the rescue of the
holy sepulchre, a project which he had contemplated. This faith or enthusiasm
runs through the whole tissue of his strange and chequered life.</p>

made by the people in Charlotte town, Mecklenburg county, North Carolina,
in May, 1775. All doubt on this subject is now dispelled, and the honor of such
declaration must be accorded to them. In a letter from Mr. Bancroft, American
minister at London, to Governor Swain, of North Carolina, dated London,
July 4th, 1848, he says: "You may be sure that I have spared no pains to
discover in the British state paper office a copy of the resolves of the committee
of Mecklenburg, and <i>with entire success</i>. The first account of 'the extraordinary
resolves of the people in Charlotte town, Mecklenburg county,' was
sent over to England by Sir James Wright, then governor of Georgia, (to whom
they had found their way) in a letter of the 20th of June, 1775. The newspaper
thus transmitted is still preserved, and is the number 498 of the South Carolina
Gazette and County Journal, Tuesday, June 13, 1775."&mdash;"It is identically the
same with the paper which you enclosed to me."&mdash;The letter of Sir James
Wright, referred to by Mr. Bancroft, closes as follows: "By the enclosed
paper, your lordship will see the extraordinary resolves of the people of Charlotte
town, in Mecklenburg county: I should not be surprised if the same should
be done every where else"</p>

troops, that these abrupt changes of party were observed; the inhabitants of
Pennsylvania flocked, in like manner, to humble themselves at the feet of the
English commissioners, and to promise them fealty and obedience. Among
others, were Mr. Gallaway and Mr. Allen, both of whom had been members of
the continental congress. Their example became pernicious, and the most
prejudicial effects were to be apprehended from it. Every day ushered in some
new calamity; the cause of America seemed hastening to irrecoverable ruin.
The most ardent no longer dissembled that the term of the war was at hand,
and that the hour was come in which the colonies were about to resume the yoke.</p>



<p><a name="Footnote_44_44" id="Footnote_44_44"></a><a href="#FNanchor_44_44"><span class="label">[44]</span></a> General Lee had been a British officer, and had engaged in the American
service before the acceptance of the resignation of his commission. Sir William
Howe, for this reason, pretended to view him as a traitor, and at first
refused to admit him on his parole, or to consider him as a subject of exchange.
Congress directed Washington to propose to General Howe to give six Hessian
officers in exchange for him; but Howe still persisting in his refusal, Congress
ordered that Lieutenant-colonel Campbell and five Hessian officers should be
imprisoned, and treated as General Lee. This order was executed even with
more rigor than it prescribed. The lieutenant-colonel, being then at Boston,
was thrown into a dungeon destined for malefactors. Washington blamed this
excess; he knew that Lee was detained, but not ill-treated. Lieutenant-colonel
Campbell and the Hessians were not liberated until General Howe had
consented to consider Lee as a prisoner of war.</p>

good grace. Chance one day threw into his hands an old almanac, containing
<i>Poor Richard's Maxims</i>, by Dr. Franklin. In that curious assemblage of
useful instructions, a man is advised, "if he wishes to have any business faithfully
and expeditiously performed, to go and do it himself&mdash;otherwise, to send."
Jones was immediately struck, upon reading this maxim, with the impropriety
of his past conduct, in only sending letters and messages to court, when he
ought to have gone in person. He instantly set out, and, by dint of personal
representation, procured the immediate equipment of the squadron, which afterwards
spread terror along the Eastern coasts of England, and with which he so gloriously captured the Serapis, and the British ships of war returning from
the Baltic. In gratitude to Dr. Franklin's maxim, he named the principal ship
of his squadron after the name of the pretended almanac-maker, <i>Le Bon
Homme Richard</i>, the Good Man Richard.</p>

he was a friend to America, and often told the ministers some very unwelcome
truths. The following good story is told of him: One afternoon, Jenkinson,
the first Lord Liverpool, left the house when the member from Hull rose to
speak; and presuming that the honorable gentleman would, as usual, deliver a
very long, dull speech, he walked home, mounted his horse, and rode to his
country-house, where he dined; and, after strolling for some time about his
grounds, returned at a gentle pace to town. On his arrival at home, he sent a
messenger to the house to ascertain what had been done, and how soon the
division might be expected to take place. The reply he received was, that
Mr. Hartley had not yet done speaking; and when Jenkinson, at length,
thought it advisable, in order to be in time for voting, to go down to Westminster,
he found the long-winded orator still on his legs!</p>

from Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, and perhaps Mr. Martin,
from Maryland, who made with them a common cause, though on different
principles. Connecticut and New York were against a departure from the
principles of the confederation, wishing rather to add a few new powers to
congress, than to substitute a national government. The states of New Jersey
and Delaware were opposed to a national government, because its patrons
considered a proportional representation of the states as the basis of it. The
eagerness displayed by the members opposed to a national government, from
these different motives, began now to produce serious anxiety for the result of the
convention. Mr. Dickinson said to Mr. Madison: 'You see the consequence
of pushing things too far. Some of the members from the small states wish
for two branches in the general legislature, and are friends to a good national
government; but we would sooner submit to foreign power, than submit to be
deprived, in both branches of the legislature, of an equality of suffrage, and
thereby be thrown under the dominion of the larger states.'"&mdash;<i>Madison Papers.</i></p>

<p><a name="Footnote_63_63" id="Footnote_63_63"></a><a href="#FNanchor_63_63"><span class="label">[63]</span></a> Never did a magistrate exercise power entrusted to him, with stricter fidelity
than Washington. In respect to appointments to and removals from office, no
man could be more conscientious. Private friendship exerted no influence,
where the public good could not be subserved. A lofty patriotism swayed him.
Even the enemies of Washington&mdash;they were never many&mdash;but the few who,
at length, opposed the measures of his administration, had no occasion to censure
him for conferring office on men whose only claim was friendship, or political
affinity to the president. The following anecdote will serve to illustrate the
integrity of the first chief magistrate of the union&mdash;happy had it been for the
country, and for the honor and reputation of some of his successors in that
exalted office, had they followed, in this respect, the "footsteps of an illustrious
predecessor."
</p>
<p>
"During his administration, an application was made to him by a gentleman
who had been the friend and companion of the general throughout the whole
course of the Revolutionary war, during which he had received, on various
occasions, indubitable marks of his kindness and partiality. He had become,
in the estimation, if not of himself, of his friends, in a degree necessary to the
happiness of Washington, and had therefore, in their opinion, only to apply for
the office, to receive it. It was a boon, which, while it would ensure competency
and ease to a friend, would bring that friend into frequent intercourse
with his patron and former associate in arms.
</p>
<p>
"For the same office, however, there was a competitor; but as he was
decidedly hostile to the politics of Washington, and had made himself conspicuous
among the opposers of his administration, no serious apprehensions were
felt from this quarter. Towards such a man&mdash;a well-known political enemy&mdash;Washington
surely could feel under no obligations, and was not likely to prefer
such a one to a personal friend and favorite. Every one acquainted with the
pretensions of the two applicants, was at no loss to judge as to the president's
decision, and the concurrent opinion was in favor of the friend and against his
competitor.
</p>
<p>
"Judge, then, the general surprise, when it was announced that the political
opponent of Washington was appointed and the former associate of the general
in the toils and deprivations of the camp, was left destitute and dejected.
</p>
<p>
"When his decision was known, a mutual friend, who interested himself in
the affair, ventured to remonstrate with the president on the injustice of his
appointment. 'My friend,' replied this illustrious man, 'I receive with a cordial
welcome; he is welcome to my house, and welcome to my heart; but, with all
his good qualities, he is not a man of business. His opponent, with all his
political hostility to me, is a man of business. My private feelings have nothing
to do in the case! I am not George Washington, but president of the United
States. As George Washington, I would do this man any kindness in my
power; but as president of the United States, I can do nothing.'"</p>

reached America December 25th. But, having no authority to negotiate until
the president should rëcall his proclamation of July 2d, and the president
declining to accede to such a preliminary, the negotiations, for the time, closed.
In November, 1811, the British minister communicated to the secretary of
state, that the attack on the Chesapeake was unauthorized by his majesty's
government; that the officer at that time in command on the American coast,
had been rëcalled; that the men, taken from the Chesapeake, should be
restored, and that suitable pecuniary provision should be made for those who suffered in the attack, and for the families of the seamen that fell. To these
propositions the president acceded. But the question, touching the right of
search, was left undecided.</p>
